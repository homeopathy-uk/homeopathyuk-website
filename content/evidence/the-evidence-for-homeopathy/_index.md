There is a growing body of published research in good quality peer-reviewed journals showing that homeopathy has a positive effect.

This section of the website gives you a straightforward introduction to the kinds of evidence that exist for homeopathy and the range of [conditions along with evidence](http://localhost/evidence/conditions-with-overall-positive-evidence-for-homeopathy/).

#### More research needed

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/research.jpg)Homeopathic research is still in its infancy. The body of evidence that exists shows that much more investigation is required – 44% of all the randomised controlled trials carried out have been positive, 5% negative and 47% inconclusive. Unfortunately, homeopathy does not attract large amounts of funding. More funding is required to conduct high quality trials using suitable research methods.  At present, for example, only 63 of the 188 RCT papers have studied classical, individualised homeopathy; each of the other 125 RCT papers has investigated the effect of one selected homeopathic medicine.

For a more in-depth review of the entire evidence base, including negative and inconclusive trials, [visit the research section of the Faculty of Homeopathy website](http://www.facultyofhomeopathy.org/research/).

A grant-funded systematic review programme will provide, in due course, a comprehensive analysis of the research literature.

##### Randomised placebo-controlled trials

The widely accepted method of proving whether or not a medical intervention works is called a randomised controlled trial (RCT). One group of patients, the control group, receive placebo (a “dummy” pill) or standard treatment, and another group of patients receive the medicine being tested. The trial becomes double-blinded when neither the patient nor the practitioner knows which treatment the patient is getting. RCTs are often referred to as the “gold standard” of clinical research.

Up to the end of 2014, a total of 104 papers reporting good-quality placebo-controlled RCTs in homeopathy (on 61 different medical conditions) have been published in peer-reviewed journals. 41% of these RCTs have reported a balance of positive evidence, 5% a balance of negative evidence, and 54% have not been conclusively positive or negative. For full details of all these RCTs and more in-depth information on the research in general, [visit the research section of the Faculty of Homeopathy’s website](http://www.facultyofhomeopathy.org/research/). Also, see [two-page evidence summary](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/2-page-evidence-summary-for-homeopathy-HRI.pdf) with full references.

The above figures are strikingly similar to data obtained from an analysis of 1016 systematic reviews of RCTs (and therefore of many more than that number of RCTs) in conventional medicine: 44% of the reviews concluded that the interventions studied were likely to be beneficial (positive); 7% concluded that the interventions were likely to be harmful (negative); and 49% reported that the evidence did not support either benefit or harm (non-conclusive).

##### Systematic reviews

The most solid evidence for a treatment comes from critically assessing more than one RCT in a carefully defined way. This is known as a systematic review. Six out of seven major systematic reviews of RCTs in homeopathy have concluded (with important caveats) that homeopathy has an effect greater than placebo.  Systematic reviews of RCTs in specific medical areas have presented positive conclusions for homeopathy in six: **childhood diarrhoea, hay fever, post-operative ileus, respiratory tract infection, rheumatic diseases** and **vertigo** ([see Faculty of Homeopathy website for details](http://facultyofhomeopathy.org/research/systematic-reviews-of-rcts/)).

For full details of all 104 placebo-controlled RCT papers and more in-depth information on the research, visit the research section of the Faculty of Homeopathy’s website.  This includes details of those RCTs that were either negative or non-conclusive. [A grant-funded systematic review programme](http://localhost/systematic-review-programme/) is providing further insight into these research findings.

##### Difficulties and opportunities with RCTs

The RCT model of measuring efficacy of a drug poses some challenges for homeopathic research. In homeopathy, treatment is usually tailored to the individual. A homeopathic prescription is based not only on the symptoms of disease in the patient but also on a host of other factors that are particular to that patient, including lifestyle, emotional health, personality, eating habits and medical history. The “efficacy” of an individualised homeopathic intervention is thus a complex blend of the prescribed medicine together with the other facets of the in-depth consultation and integrated health advice provided by the practitioner; under these circumstances, the specific effect of the homeopathic medicine itself may be difficult to quantify with precision in RCTs.

Nevertheless, in the first phase of [a grant-funded systematic review programme](http://localhost/systematic-review-programme/), examining placebo-controlled trials of individualised treatment across a total of 24 medical conditions, we observed a small overall effect of homeopathy that was statistically significantly greater than that of placebos. These findings cautiously suggest that prescribed homeopathic medicines **do** have specific treatment effects, at least in a majority of the conditions included in our analysis.

An alternative research approach, which the majority of researchers have adopted, is the “one drug fit all patients” type of RCT, akin to a conventional drug trial. Such trials are capable of quantifying efficacy of the homeopathic “drug” under investigation, but they may yield results that are of questionable relevance to the practice of homeopathy in the “real world”. This concern is also being examined in [a grant-funded programme of systematic reviews](http://localhost/systematic-review-programme/).

##### Non-randomised studies

There are other types of study that form part of the evidence base for any medical intervention. Clinical outcome studies record the patient’s self-reported response after treatment. Studies of this kind are neither randomised nor controlled. Although they lie near the lower end of the “hierarchy” of research evidence, study designs such as these can reflect how homeopathy is working in practice and indicate where RCT research might be targeted.

##### The experience of patients

Many patients referred for homeopathic treatment have a complexity of health problems. They may suffer from more than one disease. They could be young children or elderly people. They may be pregnant. None of these sorts of patients would be accepted for a drug trial in conventional medicine, so their reactions to treatment are not reflected in the results of RCTs. The recording of clinical data from everyday practice reflects the experiences of real patients and is becoming an increasingly valued part of evidence-based medicine.

There are 21 non-randomised studies that have focused on a particular medical condition or set of conditions.
