#### _Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)_

There has been little research conducted in veterinary homeopathy. Up to March 2011, there were only **38** RCTs published in the entire peer-reviewed journal literature. The details below are based on our systematic review of the world’s RCT literature in veterinary homeopathy [Mathie RT, Hacke  D, Clausen J. (2012). Randomised controlled trials of veterinary homeopathy: characterising the peer-reviewed research literature for systematic review. Homeopathy; 101: 196–203].

By the end of 2013, the total number of peer-reviewed RCTs had risen to **44** (19 placebo controlled; 25 controlled by another comparator). We highlight here the **12** (63%) of the 19 placebo-controlled trials in which the original authors interpreted their main findings as positive:

(Note that no account has been taken here of trial quality, which is the subject of our continuing programme of systematic review and meta-analysis. In [our first detailed published review](http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/175/15/373.abstract ),13 we confirmed significantly positive results in 6 of the above 12 trials.2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 Only one of these trials was judged to comprise reliable evidence,8 indicating an obvious need for new and higher quality research in this field.)

#### _Clinical outcome studies_

Conditions and species with research that did not include a control group (all positive findings):

Mastitis in cattle 14
Kennel cough in dogs 15
Epilepsy in dogs 16
Cushing’s disease in dogs and horses 17
Stillbirth in pigs 18

#### **_BHA research_**

In collaboration with Bristol University Veterinary School, the British Homeopathic Association has published pilot findings of a [research initiative studying atopic dermatitis in dogs]/evidence/research-initiative-studying-atopic-dermatitis-in-dogs/).18
