#### Safety

A review of the safety of homeopathy, conducted by doctors associated with the former Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine), studied papers published between 1970 and 1995 for reports of adverse effects of homeopathy.

Adverse effects reported in clinical trials were temporary aggravations of symptoms or other mild and transient effects (mostly headaches, tiredness, skin eruptions, dizziness or diarrhoea).

Only a very few isolated reports of proper adverse effects were attributable to homeopathic medicines.1 The authors of the review concluded: "Homeopathic medicines in high dilutions, prescribed by trained professionals, are probably safe and unlikely to provoke serious adverse reactions".

One of the expressed reasons for the popularity of homeopathy among patients at the RLHH is that it does not have the side effects associated with many conventional drugs.2

#### Cost benefit

The available evidence suggests that homeopathy has the potential to generate savings through reduced conventional prescribing and demand for other services.3 A full economic evaluation of homeopathy has, to date, taken place only once, mainly because of the large resources involved in doing so.  The single study of this type – in Germany – the cost-effectiveness of the commercial homeopathic preparation Sinfrontal® was assessed in a placebo-controlled trial of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis.4   Sinfrontal® led to average incremental savings of 275 euros per patient compared with placebo over 22 days.

Another research group in Germany compared homeopathic and conventional GPs’ outcomes in chronic diagnoses commonly treated in general practice (adults – headache, low back pain, depression, insomnia, sinusitis; children – atopic asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis).5 They collected data at 6 and 12 months regarding symptom severity, quality of life, and costs of consultations, medication, physiotherapy, hospitalisation, sick pay and medical devices. 493 patients were treated by 101 homeopathic GPs and 59 conventional GPs. The findings suggested that patients who received homeopathic treatment had better outcomes for similar cost.

Studies elsewhere, including the United Kingdom, have also shown that the purchase costs of orthodox drugs and procedures fell after the introduction of homeopathy.6–12 Moreover, a comparative study has suggested that homeopathic management of children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections was more cost-effective than conventional care.13 Another study concluded that homeopathy might be able to reduce the need for antibiotics in children with acute otitis media.14
