+++

His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester has shown his support for homeopathy by attending a reception organised by the British Homeopathic Association (BHA).

The Duke is the BHA’s Royal Patron and agreed to attend the event to highlight the work the charity does in promoting the health benefits of homeopathy, funding research and education, and campaigning for it to be more widely available on the NHS.

Addressing an audience of specially invited guests at London’s Vintners’ Hall, The Duke said he was brought up on homeopathy and remembers as a child being treated with arnica and calendula and other remedies for various childhood illnesses.

He went on to describe homeopathy as a “rare branch of medicine” and, emphasising one of the BHA’s main objectives, concluded by saying that everyone in the country should have access to homeopathy if they wanted it. “If it works,” he said, “why not use it!”
