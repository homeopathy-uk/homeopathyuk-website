BHA Chair Margaret Wyllie is celebrating 50 years of membership of Gifford Golf Club by holding a charity Texas Scramble in aid of the BHA.  Mixed teams of ladies and gents will compete over 9 holes and then enjoy a light lunch in the clubhouse whilst the prizes are awarded.  The date has been chosen to coincide with Homeopathy Awareness Week, which this year is focussing on sport.  This event will provide a fantastic opportunity to spread the word about homeopathy.

Margaret is a former Lady Captain of the club, a parkland course in the foothills of the Lammermuirs.  Gifford is popular with visitors who come to Scotland to play the championship links on the coast and is recognised as being the best 9-hole course in the UK and in the top 10 in the world.  East Lothian boasts around 20 courses, and an additional 3 designated for children only (though an adult is allowed to accompany them!).

This competition is already fully booked but, if any golfers are visiting East Lothian and would like to play at Gifford, contact Margaret through the BHA and she will be happy to take you round as her guest - in exchange for a small donation for BHA funds.
