The BHA organises events for the public, its supporters and healthcare professionals throughout the year. We often work with the Faculty of Homeopathy, and other allied organisations to deliver interesting and informative events regarding homeopathy, complementary healthcare and other health-related topics. We also hold fundraising events aimed to be fun for those attending while raising funds to allow the BHA to continue its work.

News of forthcoming events will be published on this page and on our social media sites.
