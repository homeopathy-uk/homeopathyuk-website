### Synopsis

Filmmaker and homeopath Ananda More, Hom, DHMHS investigates multiple media campaigns against homeopathy, propelling her to travel the world and uncover whether homeopathy is truly science-based and effective or a mere placebo that endangers lives. When meeting with scientists, skeptics, practitioners and patients, Ananda unravels the high drama and intrigue that envelops homeopathy today.

Current science postulates that it can’t work because we can’t prove
how it works. Similarly, in the past science could observe gravity and
electricity before it could explain it. However, homeopathy is not
granted the same latitudes or research, and instead is the target of
attacks, which disregards ever-growing volumes of compelling data.

In her travels, Ananda sees how homeopathy is being used to treat
cancer in India, support the use of antiretroviral medication for
HIV/AIDS in Africa and prevent common epidemics in Cuba.

She also visits and interviews scientists at university laboratories,
 where cutting edge experiments prove once again that maybe science
can’t always explain how nature works. However, one thing becomes
certain as intrepid professionals expose their work: homeopathy may
offer a deep acting and gentle alternative in contrast to conventional
medicine, which often focuses on toxic treatments that can have
irreversible or life threatening side effects.

With homeopathy-friendly Switzerland as the final stop,
Ananda reveals how ultimately, those most affected by policies that
support prolonged treatment and subsequent profits are the people
themselves, who are now being denied accurate information about their
health choices.
