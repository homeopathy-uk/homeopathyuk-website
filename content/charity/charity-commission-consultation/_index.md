![charity commission](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/charity-commission.jpg)The Charity Commission (CC) is currently conducting a public consultation on whether organisations promoting the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) should have charitable status. They are seeking your views which you can supply by visiting:

As you will see, the focus of this consultation is on the evidence for the effectiveness of CAM therapies.

While the BHA feels CAM charities are being unfairly targeted, it will be submitting a response to the consultation in which it will be making the following points:

  * there are many types of evidence that should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of a therapy. These include scientific studies, patient feedback and the clinical experience of doctors who have trained in a CAM discipline.  Within Homeopathy there is considerable evidence which can be found ([/evidence/the-evidence-for-homeopathy]/evidence/the-evidence-for-homeopathy/) or ([https://www.hri-research.org/resources/research-databases](https://www.hri-research.org/resources/research-databases/))

  * many conventional therapies have inconclusive evidence. Will the CC be conducting a similar consultation on the charitable status of organisations that promote these therapies?

  * inconsistent evidence is often the result of the complexity of both the medical condition being treated and the therapy being used. It is not indicative of a therapy that doesn’t work

  * removing all therapies or interventions that have inconsistent or inconclusive evidence would seriously limit the medical profession’s  ability to help patients.

  * all over the world, there are doctors, nurses, midwives, vets and other healthcare professional who integrate  CAM therapies into their daily practice because they see effectiveness. They would not use these therapies if they did not see their patients benefitting from them.  For example in the UK, within the NHS hospital setting, outcome studies demonstrate the effectiveness of homeopathy. ([/evidence/results-from-the-homeopathic-hospitals]/evidence/results-from-the-homeopathic-hospitals/))

  * practitioners of many CAM therapies belong to registering bodies which expect their members to comply with the highest professional standards in regards to training and practice

  * likewise, in the UK the producers and suppliers of  CAM treatments (homeopathy, herbal medicine etc) are strictly regulated

  * as well as providing valuable information to the growing number of people seeking to use CAM as part of their healthcare, CAM charities frequently fund treatment for those people, particularly the elderly and those on a low income, whose health has benefitted from these therapies but who cannot afford them. This meets the CC’s criterion of providing a public benefit.
