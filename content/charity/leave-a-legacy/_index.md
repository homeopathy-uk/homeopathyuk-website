By remembering the BHA in your will, you can help ensure that the benefits of homeopathy are available to future generations. It will cost you nothing today, but will make all the difference to the BHA in the future.

#### A vital source of income

The BHA relies solely on voluntary donations. A high proportion of valuable income comes from legacies left by people who share our commitment to homeopathy. Without these legacies we would not be able to sustain and develop our important work. Any legacy - no matter how large or small - is always put to the best possible use.

#### Making a pledge

If you would like to remember the BHA in your will, there are several kinds of legacy you can leave. A **residual legacy** is a bequest of part of, or the remainder of, your estate once your family have been provided for. A **pecuniary legacy** is a specified sum of money determined when the will or codicil is written. A **specific legacy** is the gift of a particular item of value.

If you are thinking of making a pledge, or have already done so, it would really help us to know. You can tell us by either completing the [Statement of intent form](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Legacy_leaflet_insert.pdf) or fill in the contact form below and we'll be in touch. Please be assured that any statement of intent is not binding. It will simply help us to plan our future work with confidence.
