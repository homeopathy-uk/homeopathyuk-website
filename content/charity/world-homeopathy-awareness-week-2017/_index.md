The BHA is organising a viewing of _Just One Drop_, an exciting new film about homeopathy which sets out to deliver the facts about the therapy.

The film is produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, a documentary filmmaker for over 25 years. Her high-profile films have been screened at film festivals around the world, won numerous awards and been nominated for an Emmy. In her latest film Ms Chiten adopts an impartial journalistic approach to investigate homeopathy and the controversy surrounding it, with quite startling results.

In honour of World Homeopathy Awareness Week 2017, the BHA has been pushing out homeopathy related content via social media.
