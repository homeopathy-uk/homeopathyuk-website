+++

Homeopathy Awareness Week in the UK has been moved to April to bring this annual celebration of homeopathic medicine in line with the rest of the world.

Starting on 10th April (Samuel Hahnemann's birthday) and running until the 16th of the month, World Homeopathy Awareness Week allows patients, supporters and practitioners of the healing art to promote its wonderful health benefits.

As the Olympics will be taking place in the summer, this year the focus will be on sports injuries and how homeopathy can help professional athletes and sporting weekend warriors maintain good health and recover from injury.
