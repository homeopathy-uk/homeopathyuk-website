Every year between 14-21 June we encourage people to raise awareness about homeopathy.

For Homeopathy Awareness Week (HAW) the BHA asked its supporters to write  in with their personal stories of  how homeopathy has helped them and their families. Each day during HAW we shared their experiences with you.
