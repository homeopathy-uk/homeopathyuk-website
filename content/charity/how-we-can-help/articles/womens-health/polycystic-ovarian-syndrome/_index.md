**Mollie Hunton**_** describes how she treats this condition homeopathically

**Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) used to be called Stein-Leventhal syn­drome when I was at medical school, and was so rare that no gynaecologist could find a case of it to demonstrate to us. Now, however, it is extremely com­mon and I see about ten cases a year.

The symptoms in the syndrome are acne, irregular or absent periods, obe­sity, hirsutism (excessive growth of bod­ily hair) and infertility. Not all patients have every symptom. In fact some peo­ple are not overweight. This can cause difficulty when doctors are not inclined to refer for investigations if the patient does not fit all the categories.

An ultrasound scan shows that suf­ferers have changes in the ovaries which cause multiple small cysts to occur with­out ovulation. The cysts are arranged around the outside of the ovary, just under the surface and have not been able to rupture as they should at ovulation.

As ovulation does not occur, hor­mone levels do not fall as they would normally do. Consequently menstrua­tion, which occurs in response to falling levels of hormones, may be delayed or absent. I feel that this situation should be able to be picked up early in teenagers who do not menstruate regularly. At this point, some homeopathic remedies would help, but the patient and the doc­tor need to be aware that irregularity may indicate pathology and some tests need to be done, even if no other symp­toms are present. I call this early stage the “tough ovary” situation. It is as if the covering (capsule) of the ovary is too tough to allow the follicle to burst when it has ripened. Some cyclical Folli­culinum and Ovarian gland in 30c potency usually helps at this early stage.

The elevated levels of testosterone and oestrogen eventually result in hir­sutism, acne and long or absent mens­trual cycles and obesity. A primary cause is thought to be high levels of insulin due to insulin resistance, where the body tis­sues do not respond normally to insulin which may be a genetic abnormality. Women with this syndrome (also called Syndrome X) are therefore at risk of pre­mature heart attacks, premature menopause and abnormal growth of the uterine lining (endometrium) which can lead to cancer.

Conventional treatment of the infer­tility, which is what takes most women to their doctor, is with clomiphene, which is said to induce ovulation in 70 per cent of patients. Inducing ovulation is not the same as getting pregnant though. If people are overweight, a low carbohydrate load diet is advised and also the medication metformin which people with type 2 diabetes take.

In order to understand this complex syndrome I analysed ten patients I had seen in the previous year. I was look­ing to see how each patient presented, which homeopathic medicines were suc­cessful and what the outcome was.

**The patients

**The youngest was 18, two were in their 20s and seven in their 30s, the oldest being 39. This reflects the situation that people are waiting until later to start their families and when they want to become pregnant find that they have a problem. The 18 year-old was a student, but everyone else was in full-time work, often in busy, stressful jobs like teaching.

**Symptoms experienced

Acne** Seven patients had acne and two had had Roaccutane which can only be prescribed by a consultant dermatolo­gist. At no time was PCOS considered as a diagnosis. Dermatologists do not normally ask about periods.

**Hirsutism** Seven patients had abnormal body hair. One had had it since the age of 16 and was now 31.

**Menstrual cycle** All the patients had abnormally long menstrual cycles. Six had had the problem since they started menstruating. Usually if a teenager goes to the doctor complaining of a long cycle, investigations for PCOS are not under­taken and the patient is reassured that things will settle down. I don’t know if anyone has done any research to see what proportion of young girls who complain of a long cycle do revert to normal and how long it takes, but it seems to be a missed opportunity to diagnose the con­dition. The situation of a long cycle is not common anyway in my experience, so I would take it seriously if it were pre­sented to me at that age.

**Weight **Six patients were overweight, so four were not – an important observation. None was diabetic. The Americans describe five different types of PCOS according to the variations in the symptoms, but in three of the variations the weight is nor­mal. This is one time when you can blame your glands for your weight!

**Infertility** Only four patients com­plained of infertility and in fact another was actually pregnant. The other five were not contemplating pregnancy. One patient had one child already but had been unable to conceive again and one patient had two children.

**Concomitant problems** One patient suf­fered depression and grief, one depres­sion, alcohol problems, heavy smoking, Syndrome X and bulimia, one had epilepsy and suicidal depression, one had recur­rent cystitis and Irritable Bowel Syn­drome, and one had panic attacks and had had repeated courses of antibiotics.

**Investigations

**Eight patients had had their hormone levels checked. One had not and one was not sure. Four were told that their testos­terone levels were not elevated and the rest were not told their results. Seven had had an ultrasound scan, in two of whom no cysts were seen. This does not necessarily mean that cysts were not there, only that they were not seen. Sometimes the ovaries are not easy to see if the patient is very overweight or the ovaries are positioned deep in the pelvis. One patient had not been offered a scan. This meant that only five patients had a definite diagnosis of PCOS, which tells you that the GPs do not consider a diagnosis of PCOS or that they feel the expense of the investigations is not warranted.

However, it is important to make a diagnosis because there may be treat­ment implications – diabetes and Syndrome X must not be left unchecked. I now check the blood sugar of every­one who is overweight. Although only five patients had had a definite diagno­sis, the other five had not had an expla­nation for their long menstrual cycles and other symptoms. Where there were classical symptoms of PCOS but no con­firmatory test results, I explained my theory of the “tough ovarian capsule” situation. I did suggest to three patients that they ask their GPs for tests and one person was refused.

**Treatment

**It is very important for people who are overweight to lose it and for diabetics and women who have Syndrome X to stick to a low carbohydrate (glycemic) load way of eating. Glycemic load is sim­ply the best measure of whether a food, a meal, or a diet will help create blood sugar control, and help lose weight (see Patrick Holford’s web site or his book Low GL Diet Made Easy). People who are overweight all have emotional prob­lems focussed on food, for example com­fort eating. One patient in this study had bulimia, which always is emotional in origin and has added emotional over­tones. When you embark on treating PCOS you are treating a chronic condi­tion that has often been present, albeit unrecognised, for many years, which is why people become depressed. Homeo­pathy is the only system that looks at the whole person and not just at their hor­mones and ovaries.

**Case study

**Mrs KJ, aged 31, came to see me because she had had PCOS for ten years and dur­ing her first pregnancy she had a large ovarian cyst which could not be oper­ated on and she had to have a caesarean section. She was now pregnant for the second time and wanted to try and deliver normally.

Her PCOS was diagnosed at the age of 21 when she was experiencing irreg­ular bleeding. At the time she was work­ing on a ship which she found very stressful. She developed severe acne which was treated by a dermatologist with Minocin, a strong antibiotic. After this she developed irregular bleeding and a scan showed ovarian cysts. She was put onto oestrogen patches. She then conceived naturally, but developed the large cyst. The cyst was dealt with dur­ing the caesarean.

Eventually she wanted to conceive again, but was unable to. She was refer­red back to the gynaecologist and was due to have a laparoscopy when she became pregnant.

By nature she was a home person. On board ship she had been very home­sick. She was very moody and often burst into tears. She hated stuffy atmos­pheres and always slept with the win­dow open. She hated to be cold. Despite what she thought about her acne scars, she was a very attractive person with blond hair and blue eyes.

I prescribed Pulsatilla 200c, three tablets to be taken in one day once a month whilst pregnant. She did not develop any cysts and went on to deliver normally.

**Outcome

**Out of the ten patients treated, two were lost to follow up. Three were unable to handle the diet, however one had an improvement in her cycle despite having considerable emotional problems exposed which can be difficult to treat. Another felt she had had a therapeutic consultation. There were lots of improve­ments recorded in patients’ cycles, in their diets and in their mental health.

This is a complex syndrome with a lot of symptoms in different systems and often of long standing. It would obvi­ously take a long time for changes and recovery to occur. Sometimes there is not enough time and patients find the conventional system with its quick fixes hard to resist.
