For most women, homeopathic medicine can help enormously in the run-up to the birth of a baby and in avoiding or reducing some of the problems associated with labour, as well as in dealing with post-natal symptoms. This is the follow-up to the article ‘Common problems in pregnancy’, that was published in our Spring issue

**False labour **

Labour-like contractions may occur in the last few weeks of pregnancy and are felt irregularly, usually in the lower part of the abdomen. These are said to occur because the uterus (womb) is ‘toning-up’ in preparation for the birth. If the contractions become very frequent or regular, or if there is a ‘show’ of blood, the doctor or midwife should be called.

**Symptoms: **Contractions that occur early in the pregnancy. Pain shoots across the abdomen, causing doubling up.

**Medicine: **Cimicifuga

**Symptoms: **Contractions that occur in the last few weeks of pregnancy

**Medicine: **Caulophyllum

**Symptoms: **Pain goes up the back and into the hips

**Medicine: **Gelsemium

**Symptoms: **Colicky, cramp-like pains

**Medicine: **Viburnum opulus

**Dosage: ** Use the 12c potency.Take every hour until the pains cease.

**Preparing for delivery

**Taking Caulophyllum in the last weeks of the preg­nancy and Arnica before delivery will minimise much of the bruising and bleeding. Caulophyllum is also said to ‘tone up’ the uterus, helping to produce good contractions and lessening the chances of becoming over tired during labour.

**Symptoms: **Reduces the bruising and bleeding of normal labour

**Medicine: **Arnica montana

**Dosage: **Arnica should be taken in the highest potency you can obtain — the 10m potency powder form if possible. If not, use the 30c potency in powder form. If you cannot obtain a powder, simply crush one tablet for one dose. Take one dose at the start of labour and one during labour just before delivery. It is useful to take a 30c dose three times a day for three days after the birth of the baby.

**Symptoms: **Used routinely to help uterine contractions and to bring about a smooth delivery

**Medicine: **Caulophyllum

**Dosage: **Caulophyllum should be taken in the 30c potency — three doses on the same day each week from the 34th week onwards. There is no clinical evidence that this homeopathic medicine causes women to go into labour too early. This is specifically mentioned because Caulophyllum in normal — that is, non-homeopathic doses — may cause early labour. Used homeopathically, it is given to prevent premature labour and to help normal labour.

**Symptoms: **May help if there was heavy bleeding in a previous pregnancy

**Medicine: **Millefolium

**Dosage: **Millefolium should be taken in the 30c potency. Take three doses on one day in the last week of the pregnancy.

**In early labour **

A normal pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks. For a few weeks before the birth occasional painless ‘contrac­tions’ may be felt in the lower abdomen (see False Labour above). When labour proper begins, the con­tractions become noticeable but may be infrequent and irregular. As labour proceeds, they become more frequent and occur at regular intervals. They may also produce some discomfort. At first they are often felt in the back. The start of labour may be indicated by a small blood loss called a ‘show’.

At some stage the membranes in which the baby is contained will rupture, producing a loss of a watery fluid from the vagina. This is perfectly normal. The actual duration of labour varies tremendously, but is lengthier with a first pregnancy, so there is usually plenty of time in which to get to hospital or for the midwife to arrive if delivery is to be at home.

**Symptoms: **When the labour pains are frequent but irregular. A good remedy if restless, anxious and frightened and convinced of dying during labour

**Medicine: **Aconitum

**Symptoms: **Painful labour, with the pain starting in lower back and radiating to inner part of the thighs.The woman may be over-excited and angry, and resent being examined. Intolerance of pain

**Medicine: **Chamomilla

**Symptoms: **Spasmodic irregular pains in the small of the back. Feelings of exhaustion and being out of control

**Medicine: **Cocculus

**Symptoms: **Contractions are very painful but ineffective. The woman is restless and agitated.

**Medicine: **Coffea cruda

**Symptoms: **Intermittent, relatively painless contractions with little progress. Excessive tiredness

**Medicine: **Gossypium

**Symptoms: **Early labour pains in back

**Medicine: **Kali carbonicum

**Dosage:** Use the 12c potency. Take every 30 minutes until relief is maintained.

**Immediately after delivery **

The mother’s main problems after the birth will be related to bruising in the birth passage and surround­ing organs, such as the bladder and urethra.

With a prolonged labour, especially one that has caused much sleep deprivation, fatigue can also be a problem, but this is easily remedied by a good night’s sleep. The main problems after a birth by Caesarean section tend to be those that can occur after any surgical procedure.

Most of these complications are unlikely, however, if the woman has been treated with Arnica and Caulophyllum, as described above. See also the section on After-pains below.

**Medicine: **Staphysagria

**Dosage: ** Use the 12c potency. Take three times a day for five days.

**After pains **

These pains are similar to labour pains and may occur after childbirth. They are a result of the uterus (womb) contracting as it reduces to its size before the pregnancy.

The pains are more likely to occur to breastfeed­ing mothers as breastfeeding causes the pituitary gland to release the hormone oxytocin, which helps with milk production, and may also stimulate some uterine contractions.

**Symptoms: **Used routinely after all labours, especially if labour has been protracted

**Medicine: **Arnica montana
