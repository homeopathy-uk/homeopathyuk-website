PMS is a constellation of symptoms, both physical and emotional, which affect many women in the days leading up to a period, for anything from two to 14 days. It is only relatively recently that it has been recognised and accepted as a disorder with a physical cause. The term pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) is more comprehensive than pre-menstrual tension, and is preferred by women as it has a less sexist, accusatory ring. The symptoms are relieved almost as soon as the period starts. It is a very common complaint, affecting three out of four women aged 30-40.

The social implications of PMS are considerable. There is an increased incidence of anti-social behaviour, accidents, illness and psychiatric crises in pre-menstrual women. Examples of this include poor standards of school work, with fewer passes and distinctions; schoolgirls receive more than the expected number of punishments, and are more forgetful and unpunctual. A three to five per cent increase in absenteeism from work occurs around the period time. Symptoms may be severe enough to cause a fear of crossing the road or driving, so the sufferer becomes isolated, preferring to stay close to home.

Behaviour of the sufferer that is different from the norm influences the lives of partners, children, neighbours, and friends. Aggressive behaviour towards the partner may lead to counter-violence.

Children are very sensitive to their mother’s emotional state, and may respond to inexplicable mood swings by psychosomatic symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, crying and vomiting. Thus, in addition to the unpleasant symptoms and feeling of not being in control that the sufferer experiences, she may also feel guilty about the effect she is having on those closest to her. This may account for the significant number of attempted suicides in the pre-menstrual phase.

**Causes and symptoms

**The causes of PMS are many and varied. They include hereditary predisposition, emotional causes and dietary errors. Metabolically it is possible to recognise four main sub-types of PMS, depending on the symptoms experienced.

Type 1 PMS A: Symptoms are nervous tension, mood swings, anxiety and irritability. This is the most common type, affecting 65 to 75 per cent of PMS sufferers.

Type 2 PMS B: Symptoms are of fluid retention, weight gain, breast heaviness and swelling and abdominal bloating. This affects 65 to 75 per cent of sufferers with PMS and appears to be due to excess aldosterone production, which produces salt and water retention.

Type 3 PMS C:  Symptoms are sweet craving, increased appetite, dizziness and fainting. This affects 24 to 35 per cent of pre-menstrual women, and is due to decreased carbohydrate tolerance.

Type 4 PMS D:  Symptoms are depression, crying, confusion, forgetfulness and insomnia. This affects 25 to 35 per cent of women, and is more commonly found combined with PMS A, which occurs first and is followed by PMS D symptoms a few days before the onset of a period. It is characterised by high progesterone and low oestrogen.

**Additional Symptoms

**1. Skin disorders, increased tendency to acne. Skin becomes blotchy and dull with blemishes and whiteheads, and there may be a tendency to bruise. The skin is often more greasy.

2. Aches and pains due to (a) increased pressure within the tissues as retained fluid starts to collect, pressing on the nerve endings; (b) increased state of tension of the muscle fibres, possibly due to actual pre-menstrual effect on the muscle fibre, though it may also be due to mental tension; (c) painful periods caused by congestion of blood vessels in the pelvis and the genital regions - giving rise to a dull persistent pain in contrast to spasmodic period pains; (d) clumsiness.

Other more unusual symptoms are as follows: apathy, agoraphobia, panic attacks, fright, phobias, aversion to company, suspicion, feeling of detachment, suicidal tendencies, swelling of upper eyelids, hair loss, sinusitis, sore throat, numbness of the throat, backache, swelling of the hip and lower back, cutting pain in the legs, itching irritation and burning in the vagina, vaginal discharge which may be yellow and offensive, aversion to intercourse, pain on intercourse, burning pain in bladder, increase in wind and alternate constipation and diarrhoea, hot feet and a general feeling of being worse between 3 and 5pm.
