**With summer around the corner _Dr Tariq Khan_ gives you advice on how to get your feet looking their best

**An engineering miracle combining grace, durability and sensitivity – it’s an apt description of the human foot. Perhaps one of the most neglected parts of the body, generally hidden from site, the importance of feet is only fully appreciated when something goes wrong. Healthy feet in good working order give us the joy of movement. Painful, unhealthy feet makes feel tired and irritable and take the pleasure out of life.

Consider the punishment the foot absorbs in a lifetime. As we move, at a comfortable 100 steps a minute pace, each heel strikes the pavement with the equivalent of a 225lb jolt 50 times a minute. As we walk an average of 115,000 miles in a lifetime, that means tens of millions of jolts for each foot.

The five most common problems that hobble into my clinic are; Athletes foot, Corns, Cracked heels, Sore soles (plantar fasciitis), and Verrucae (plantar warts).

**1. Athlete’s foot
**This is a fungal infection. It can lead to intense itching, cracked, blistered or peeling areas of skin, redness and scaling. It can occur on moist, waterlogged skin especially between the fourth and fifth toes, or on dry, flaky skin around the heels or elsewhere on the foot. It’s caused by a number of fungal species which you can pick up from anywhere (typically communal areas such as pools, showers and changing rooms) or anywhere where you may walk around barefooted.

“The fungus on each bit of skin that falls away from someone else’s feet can be picked up by you if you’re prone.” Once your feet have been contaminated, the warm, dark and sweaty environment of feet cramped in shoes or trainers provides the ideal breeding ground for the fungus. However, athlete’s foot also occurs in dry, flaky areas.

It’s quite common in summer sandal­wearers. The sun makes your skin dry out, so it loses its natural protective oils; this combined with the constant trauma from sandals makes them more prone to infection.For prevention change your footwear on a regular basis.

There’s no point sorting your feet out if you constantly re­infect them by putting them into damp, fungally infected shoes. It takes 24-­48 hours for shoes to dry out properly, so alternate your shoes daily. To help shoes dry out more quickly, take any insoles out. Also, loosen any laces and open your shoes out fully so that air can circulate. Go for trainers with ventilation holes.

**First Aid medicines that can help: **

  * **Berberis vulgaris.** When the skin has dry, scaly lesions with circumferential progression and healing from centre outwards.

  * **Graphites.** Skin oozes a thick, viscous, honey­like fluid. The itching is relieved by localised cold while the individual is sensitive to cold.

  * **Psorinum.** Mycosis (fungal infection) found on unhealthy, dry, wrinkled, scaly, itchy skin on the sole of the foot.

  * **Sepia.** Itching not relieved by scratching, ringworm­like eruption every Spring, sweaty feet, worse on toes and intolerable odour.

  * **Silica.** Eruptions itch only in daytime and evening, Rose­coloured blotches and coppery spots.

  * **Sulphur.** Skin that is dry, scaly unhealthy, pimply eruptions and pustules. Itching especially from warmth, in the evening, often recurs in springtime, in damp weather.

Medicines should be taken initially in 6c or 12c three times a day for the first two weeks.

If fungus presents for several months or years take 30c once daily up to three months.

**2. Corns
**Corns like calluses develop from an accumulation of dead skin cells on the foot, forming thick, hardened areas. They contain a cone-shaped core with a point that can press on a nerve below, causing pain. Corns are a very common ailment that usually forms on the tops, sides and tips of the toes. Corns can become inflamed due to constant friction and pressure from footwear. Corns that form between the toes are sometimes referred to as soft corns.

There are very simple ways to prevent and treat the corns. You should wear properly fitted footwear with extra room in the toe box (toe area). Avoid shoes that are too tight or too loose. Use an orthotic or shoe insert made with materials that will absorb shock and shear forces. Also, avoid tight socks and stockings to provide a healthier environment for the foot.

Try to steer away from corn removing solutions and medicated pads. These solutions can sometimes increase irritation and discomfort. Diabetics and all other individuals with poor circulation should never use any chemical agents to remove corns.

Topical agents like Marigold ‘Tagetes’ cream or oil are found to be very effective for treatment of this condition.

**First Aid medicines that can help:
**

  * **Antimonium crudum.** Skin that is hard, thickened (Hyperkeratotic) and yellow corns, often in multiple.

  * **Ferrum picricum. **Corn, which have a yellowish discolouration. The medicine acts best in dark-haired people.

  * **Hypericum.** Neurovascular corn (a corn on the end of a nerve and blood vessel), which is painful, inflamed with burning and shooting pain.

  * **Nitric acidum.** Golden-yellow callus, local pathogenic action of nitric acid, painful fissures which bleed, giving impression of being stuck by needles. Hyperkeratosis, where the adjacent skin has golden-yellow characteristic.

  * **Rannuculus bulbosus.** Corns that are sensitive, hard and thickened skin is present.

Homeopathic medicines should be taken at 6c/12c twice daily for up to two weeks for acute conditions and 30c taken daily for up to three months for chronic conditions.

If a corn is present for sometime then seek help from a homeopathic podiatrist, who can remove it and use a topical phytotherapy based treatment to prevent it returning.

**3. Cracked heels
**Many factors cause cracked heels such as dry skin due to wearing sandals and shoes without backs, this leads to the heel building up callus due to friction and pressure bought on by walking and further leading to fissure formation with pain and bleeding.

There are others reasons such as skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis and abnormalities of the heel structure, which lead to a biomechanical instability with the bone and fascia around the heel. Patients with poor circulation and especially diabetics often do not have enough blood supplying the skin to carry out the requirements to function normally.

To help prevent cracked heels stop wearing the shoes that caused the problem. At the end of the day soak feet in warm salt water for 10 minutes to ease them and help to take down the inflammation caused by the friction and pressure of being on your feet all day. Daily application of cream or ointment, the uses of traditional plant-base preparations along with products with neem, coca butter, shea butter and vitamin E also show promising results. Pumice cracks or dry skin, make sure the sole of the shoe is well cushioned and not rough or too hard, you can put in an insole or heel cushion. Avoid shoes like flip flops and high heel shoes, if taking long walks or walking on hard surfaces.

First Aid medicines that can help:**

  * **Antimonium crudum. **Dry fissures often found on heels or external borders of feet. Scaly and pustular eruptions are often burning and itching, worse at night.

  * **Petroleum.** Skin dry, constricted, very sensitive, rough and cracked, leathery. Thick, greenish crusts, burning and itching; redness, raw; cracks bleed easily.

  * **Graphites.** Rough, hard, persistent dryness of portions of the skin, Eruptions, oozing out a sticky exudation. Cracks in heels and in between toes, burning and stinging pain.

  * **Sulphur.** Dry, scaly, unhealthy, itching, burning, worse scratching and washing.

**4. Plantar Fasclitis
(Pain in the sole of my foot)
**The plantar fascia is a broad band of fibrous tissue located along the bottom surface of the foot that runs from the heel to the forefoot. Excessive stretching of the plantar fascia, usually due to over-pronation(flat feet), causes plantar fasciitis. The inflammation caused by the plantar fascia being stretched away from the heel often leads to pain in the heel and arch areas. The pain is often extreme in the morning when an individual first gets out of bed or after a prolonged period of rest.

If this condition is left untreated and strain on the longitudinal arch continues, a bony protrusion may develop, known as a heel spur. It is important to treat the condition promptly before it worsens.

**Topical treatments that can help the following conditions:

Arnica cream** – Bruising / Arthritis
**Bellis perennis cream** – Deep bruising
**Hypericum cream **– Nerve pain
**Ruta cream** – Bony inflammation
**Rosemary tincture **– Pain

**5. Verrucae
(Plantar Warts)
**A common viral infection of the skin, verrucae (warts on the foot or hand) are a problem for more and more people who use communal areas such as swimming baths, sports and health clubs.

**General Footcare**

  * Wash your feet every day in warm soapy water (don’t soak them, as this might destroy the natural oils) and dry thoroughly, especially between the toes.

  * If your skin is dry, apply moisturising (calendula) cream all over the foot, except for between the toes.

  * Lightly apply a foot powder.

  * Remove hard skin gently with a pumice stone, but not if it is over a bony area or joint. If this is the case, or if the hard skin is painful, consult a registered chiropodist/podiatrist.

  * Trim your toe nails regularly, using proper nail clippers. Cut straight across, not too short, and not down at the corners as this can lead to in-growing nails.

  * Keep feet warm, and exercise to improve circulation.

  * Always wear the right shoe for the job.

  * Seek prompt treatment for burns, cuts and breaks in the skin, and for any unusual changes in colour or temperature. This is particularly important if you have diabetes. If your feet hurt, something is wrong!

  * You can also prevent foot problems before they occur by visiting a registered chiropodist/podiatrist for advice on how to keep your feet healthy.
