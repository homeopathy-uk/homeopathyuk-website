_**Carol Bodza**_** found homeopathy was just what she needed to recover from post-natal depression**

No more anti­depressants! I never thought for one moment that I could have lived without them. I was at an all time low when I visited my GP, Dr Jenny Howard, with my daughter who suffers from eczema. She started explaining to me that she used homeopathy for a lot of children and it worked well. Before she finished telling me about my daughter, I was almost begging her to help me.

I’d had post-natal depression for the last two years but had not told anybody. I had found myself at a point where I wanted to die; I could no longer cope with my feelings. My husband had found the job he was looking for and this meant that I had moved way from my family and friends. I was getting to a point where I could not leave the house without having a panic attack. I really hated my life.

The first few months were a blur to me, and then I was given Ignatia. It had a real impact on me. My grandmother had died just ten months before I gave birth to my daughter and I was so busy looking after my son and husband that I had not given myself a chance to grieve. About ten days after taking the Ignatia I remember getting into bed and starting to cry; I kept crying for about two hours if not more. I was able to let go. I felt fantastic. This was the first time I saw light at the end of the tunnel. It helped me let go of the guilt I felt in having rejected my daughter from the day she was born although I had a great relationship with my son. It gave me the chance to start afresh with her.

The panic attacks have taken a bit more work. Gelsemium is great when I get into a situation where I feel the dreaded panic start and Aconite helps with the hyper­ventilating. Both have given me a chance to build my confidence and learn to control the feelings which were rolling into the next state of panic. I have to say it also took a little perseverance and a stubborn streak but it is worth it.

When I hit another low, I thought it was the end of the world. I went to see an emergency GP who offered me Valium, but I knew it was not right for me so I made an appointment to see Dr Howard. Tears were rolling down my face before I had opened the door. I was scared, lonely and afraid of everything. She smiled saying she knew I would need this one day and gave me Calc carb. She described it as the protection that an oyster gets from its shell, and that is just what I needed: a cuddle in a bottle.

I enjoy my life again; I have two fantastic children, a great husband and a GP who deserves an award. The only thing that makes me sad is the fact that these services are not available to everyone on the NHS.

We have had some difficult times over the last two years but homeopathy and a fantastic GP and the support of my family have brought me through. Two years down the line – no anti­depressants and homeopathy for emergencies – I feel fantastic and hope that I can inspire others who suffer from depression. It is a horrible thing to go through. If you are reading this and thinking she can’t have felt as bad as me, believe me I have said exactly the same. I never in a million years thought I would be writing something like this. There is always hope and homeopathy!
