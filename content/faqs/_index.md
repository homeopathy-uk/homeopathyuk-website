### Which homeopathic qualifications should I look for?

The Faculty of Homeopathy is the only body in the UK which represents medically-qualified homeopaths. The most qualified members of the Faculty have MFHom, FFHom, VetMFHom or VetFFHom after their names. Some homeopathic pharmacists and podiatrists hold the Faculty's Diploma and have DFHom after their names. Licenced Associates of the Faculty of Homeopathy have LFHom after their names - they have achieved a basic level of training in homeopathy. [Find a member of the Faculty of Homeopathy near you.](/treatment/find-a-homeopath-search/)

### Is homeopathy officially regulated?

Although homeopathy itself is not currently subject to statutory regulation, doctors and other healthcare professionals who practise homeopathy are regulated by their relevant professional body. For example, Doctors are regulated by the General Medical Council [Read more about regulation](/find-a-medical-homeopath/regulation/).

### Can homeopathy provide an alternative to vaccination?

There is no evidence to show that homeopathic medicines can be used instead of vaccination. The Faculty of Homeopathy recommends that immunisation is carried out in the usual way, unless there are strong medical contraindications. For an information sheet about the balance of risks involved in making decisions about immunisation and the role that homeopathy can play, [visit our popular topics page.](/how-we-can-help-you/popular-topics/)

### Should I stop my other medication whilst taking homeopathy?

No. Homeopathic medicines can be safely taken along with other medicines. It can be very dangerous to stop a medicine which you have been using for some time. Homeopathy will not interfere with your other drugs. You will be able to reduce your other drugs under the supervision of a homeopathic doctor if you begin to improve with homeopathic treatment.
