#### Long-term problems

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine, such as arthritis, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome.

However, as a system of medicine homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can therefore be considered in almost any situation where a person's health is depleted. It can also be very useful in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.Whole person medicine.

#### Doctors, dentists, vets...

As well as doctors there are nurses, midwives, dentists, vets, pharmacists, podiatrists and osteopaths, all using homeopathy in their daily practice.

# Helping pets

One of the interesting things about homeopathy is that it can have great results in animals. Sceptics often use the argument that homeopathic treatment works because it is all in the mind of the patient. It would be hard to apply this argument to your pet cat or dog!

#### Conditions often seen

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/helping-pets.jpg)A [pilot study](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Veteinary_pilot_study_20071.pdf) published by the BHA in 2007 found that the conditions most commonly seen by homeopathic vets are arthritis, atopic dermatitis, lameness, epilepsy, diarrhoea, aggression, fear, pruritus, hyperthyroid and kidney failure. A total of 767 pets took part in the study. Patients were predominantly cats and dogs, but horses and some other smaller animals were also present in the study.

According to owners, the health of 80% of the animals that took part in the study improved.
