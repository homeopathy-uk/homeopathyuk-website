The NHS spends approximately £4 million a year on homeopathy.

The three NHS homeopathic hospitals have been a part of the NHS since it began in 1948. They currently treat tens of thousands of patients each year who are referred by GPs, PCTs and NHS specialists.

#### Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine

The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (formerly the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital) holds 27,000 NHS patient appointments a year.  All clinics are led by consultants, doctors and other registered healthcare professionals who have received additional training in complementary medicine.

#### Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital

The Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital also treats thousands of patients every year. The hospital offers the only chronic fatigue syndrome service, commissioned by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and has helped many patients with this debilitating chronic illness.

#### Bristol Homeopathic Hospital

At the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, referrals come mainly from oncologists referring patients suffering side-effects from cancer treatments.

#### GPs and homeopathy

In the UK there are over 400 GPs practising homeopathy who are regulated by the GMC and are members of the Faculty of Homeopathy. They treat around 200,000 NHS patients per year with homeopathy. GPs are able to refer NHS patients to qualified and regulated homeopaths and most private health insurance companies and cash-plans consider homeopathic treatment a good investment.
