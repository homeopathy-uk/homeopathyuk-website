#### Safe and effective

Homeopathy is perfectly safe. This is because homeopathic medicines are made from a very small amount of the active ingredient. Two hundred years of practice, research and trials have proved the safety of this gentle system of medicine for both people and animals.

#### Gentle and non-addictive

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Is-homeopathy-safe.jpg)Unlike some conventional drugs, homeopathic medicines are non-addictive and have no dangerous side-effects. Homeopathy is safe to use for babies, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women, who are under the supervision of a homeopathic doctor.

#### Regulated practice

Members of the [Faculty of Homeopathy](http://www.facultyofhomeopathy.org/) are doctors and other statutorily registered healthcare professionals bound to act within the competence of their profession and their level of training and qualification in homeopathy. This means that a homeopathic medicine would not be prescribed when, for example, a conventional treatment is actually the better option for a patient.

### Integrated approach

Homeopathy cannot replace all other forms of healthcare, but can be used as the first treatment option in a wide range of conditions. It can also be used in a complementary way in other situations, for example, to support good recovery after operations.

Homeopathy doesn’t interfere with conventional medicine and should be seen as a complementary treatment, not as an alternative.

#### The best of both worlds

Despite the differences in approach, homeopathic and conventional treatments can work very well alongside each other. Consulting a medical doctor trained in homeopathy allows you to receive the best of both worlds, with the most effective treatments being tailored just for you.
