+++

Homeopathy has been integrated into the healthcare systems of many European countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal.

A survey conducted by Global TGI in 2008 found 15% of the population of Britain trusted homeopathy.

Research carried out by market research analyst Mintel estimates U.S. retail sales of homeopathic and herbal remedies reached $6.4 billion in 2012, up almost 3% from 2011, which means the market has grown 16% over the past five years. Mintel forecasts demand will continue to increase over the next few years and by 2017 sales are expected to reach $7.5 billion as more Americans become proactive about their health and the availability of these medicines increases through mass retailers.

In India homeopathy is one of the most popular forms of medicine. Today there are are over 200,000 registered homeopathic practitioners, 215 homeopathic hospitals and 7,000 homeopathic dispensaries.
