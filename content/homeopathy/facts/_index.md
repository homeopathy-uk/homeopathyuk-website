## The growing demand for homeopathy

Homeopathy has been integrated into the healthcare systems of many European countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal.

A survey conducted by Global TGI in 2008 found 15% of the population of Britain trusted homeopathy.

Research carried out by market research analyst Mintel estimates U.S. retail sales of homeopathic and herbal remedies reached $6.4 billion in 2012, up almost 3% from 2011, which means the market has grown by 16% over the past five years. Mintel forecasts demand will continue to increase over the next few years and by 2017 sales are expected to reach $7.5 billion as more Americans become proactive about their health and the availability of these medicines increases through mass retailers.

In India homeopathy is one of the most popular forms of medicine. Today there are are over 200,000 registered homeopathic practitioners, 215 homeopathic hospitals and 7,000 homeopathic dispensaries.

#### High-profile support

**MPs**

Homeopathy enjoys a high level of support from politicians. In 2007, 206 MPs signed an Early Day Motion welcoming the contribution of homeopathy to NHS healthcare.

**Celebrities**

David Beckham, Twiggy, Roger Daltrey, Caprice, Susan Hampshire, Tina Turner, Louise Jameson, Gaby Roslin, Jude Law, Sadie Frost, Nadia Sawalha, Richard Branson, Debra Stephenson and Meera Syal, as well as HM The Queen are all users of homeopathy.

## Homeopathy and the NHS

#### NHS homeopathic hospitals

As well as around 400 GPs who integrate homeopathy into their practice in the UK, there are three NHS homeopathic hospitals – Bristol, London and Glasgow. All have been part of the NHS since it was founded in 1948. These are consultant-led services staffed by fully qualified doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who have additional training in homeopathy and other complementary therapies such as acupuncture. Patients are referred to the NHS homeopathic hospitals in the usual way – by their GP or specialist.

The homeopathic hospitals are a unique asset to the NHS, for several reasons:

  * They offer patients genuine choice of treatment by providing evidence-based, highly professional complementary medicine.  Most patients are unable to afford private treatment.

  * Although small they are highly innovative: for instance acupuncture for pain and complementary cancer care, both now widely available in the NHS, were pioneered by the homeopathic hospitals.

  * They have made important research contributions, for instance researching “effectiveness gaps” – conditions for which GPs lack effective treatments – and the outcome and cost-effectiveness of complementary medicine.

The hospitals help many patients including those with complex chronic problems and for whom conventional medicine has proved ineffective or caused with serious side-effects. The treatments offered by the homeopathic hospitals are complementary to, and integrated with, conventional treatment. Treatment is provided by qualified healthcare professionals working within the NHS.

#### Hospitals at risk

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/patient-hospital.jpg)Although the government has re-affirmed its commitment to homeopathy in the NHS, local NHS commissioning and the financial crisis currently affecting the NHS have placed these unique national assets at risk. Decisions that affect patients’ ability to choose their treatment are being made to satisfy short-term financial needs by NHS commissioners who have little understanding of the value that homeopathic hospitals provide.

#### Comparing numbers

NHS spending on homeopathy is very small.

Total NHS budget: £110 billion

Annual spend on inpatients with adverse reactions to drugs: £466 million

Annual spend on management consultants: £300 million

Annual spend on homeopathy: £4 million

The contracts the homeopathic hospitals have with Primary Care Trusts are a minuscule proportion of the NHS budget – and yet make such a big difference to patients. Outcome studies from the hospitals consistently show that well over two-thirds of patients feel better after treatment.

## Veterinary homeopathy

An increasing number of veterinary surgeons practise homeopathy in the UK, many of whom are registered with the Faculty of Homeopathy.

#### The benefits

A veterinary surgeon trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both. Homeopathy can be used equally well for minor conditions and for more chronic problems when prolonged treatment may be required.

#### Veterinary clinical outcomes survey

In October 2010 the Faculty of homeopathy’s data collection study in cats and dogs was published.

In the largest study of its type ever conducted, the clinical outcomes survey has identified a number of clinical conditions in cats and dogs that may be promising targets for future research in veterinary homeopathy.  Twenty-one homeopathic veterinary surgeons in the UK recorded data from their patients over a 12-month period and collected information from a total of 400 cats and 1500 dogs.

The most frequently treated feline conditions were dermatitis, renal failure, over-grooming, arthritis and hyperthyroidism.  The most commonly recorded canine conditions were dermatitis, arthritis, pyoderma (a bacterial infection of the skin), colitis and fear.  By owners’ assessments, a moderate or major improvement was reported overall for 63% of cats and for 68% of dogs1.

#### Regulation

Veterinary surgeons who practise homeopathy are registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and must retain their professional membership of this body in order to practise. It is illegal to treat animals if you are not a qualified veterinary surgeon.

#### Finding a homeopathic vet

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/finding-a-homeopathic-vet.jpg)Pet owners can search for a vet who practises homeopathy in their area by visiting our [Find a Homeopath]/treatment/find-a-homeopath-search/) page.

Owners can ask their current vet to refer them to a homeopathic vet, or make an appointment direct.
