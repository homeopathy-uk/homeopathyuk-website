**Immunisation**

**Malaria**

**Swine flu**

## Immunisation

**The BHA follows the advice of the [Faculty of Homeopathy](http://facultyofhomeopathy.org/immunisation/) on immunisation:**

Where there is no medical contraindication, immunisation should be carried out in the normal way using the conventional tested and approved vaccines. Where there is a medical contraindication and/or a patient would otherwise remain unprotected against a specific infectious disease, it may be appropriate to consider the use of the relevant homeoprophylactic preparation applicable to that disease.

In the case of veterinary vaccination protocols, in view of the current debate about the necessity for annual boosters and about the evidence supporting recommended booster frequency and safety, the Faculty advises veterinary surgeons carefully to review the published evidence, in order to form an opinion and, if necessary to consult other Veterinary Members of the Faculty. This advice notwithstanding, the Faculty cannot support leaving animals with no form of prophylactic cover against the major, potentially lethal infectious diseases.

## Malaria

**The BHA follows the advice of the Faculty of Homeopathy on malaria. See below:**

The Faculty of Homeopathy, the professional body for doctors and other statutorily regulated healthcare professionals who integrate homeopathy into their practice, does not promote the use of homeopathy for the prevention of malaria.

It also supports steps to inform the public of the dangers of malaria and the need to follow government guidance. In 2005 the Faculty worked with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on a statement for the HPA [website](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/homeopathic_statement_260705.htm) (archived).

“Malaria is a serious and life-threatening disease and there is no published evidence to support the use of homeopathy in the prevention of malaria,” comments Dr Peter Fisher, a member of the Faculty of Homeopathy and Clinical Director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital. “The Faculty of Homeopathy recommends following the HPA guidelines.”

## Swine flu

**The BHA follows the advice of the Faculty of Homeopathy on swine flu:**

The Faculty of Homeopathy supports the Department of Health in its approach to a possible pandemic of swine influenza A(H1N1).

Key in this approach is to prevent the spread of infection by

  * Ensuring you wash your hands regularly with soap and water

  * Regularly cleaning surfaces, including door handles, to remove contamination

  * Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneezing

  * Placing used tissues in a bin as soon as possible.

  * If you fear you may have swine flu contact your GP or NHS Direct immediately.

Homeopathy has a place in assisting the body to heal and lessen the symptoms.
