<td style="vertical-align: top;" >Enter your postcode (or country) to search for homeopathic practitioners near you.

The BHA’s online directory of practitioners lists hundreds of homeopaths, all of whom are members of one of the main registering bodies: If you are seeking a doctor or other healthcare professional who is also a trained homeopath you can tick the appropriate box. Alternatively, you can perform a general search using your postcode or country. This will pull up all practitioners within the selected radius of your postcode.

All the homeopaths listed on our online directory of practitioners are members of one of the main registering bodies:

  * [The Faculty of Homeopathy](http://facultyofhomeopathy.org/)

  * [Society of Homeopaths](http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/)

  * [Alliance of Registered Homeopaths](http://www.a-r-h.org/)

  * [The Homeopathic Medical Association](http://www.the-hma.org/)

Practitioners highlighted in **colour** are healthcare professionals and Faculty of Homeopathy members.
