##### Regulated practitioners

Members  of the Faculty of Homeopathy listed on our online directory  are all are healthcare professionals who have completed postgraduate training in homeopathy. This means they are regulated by their relevant professional body. For example, doctors are regulated by the General Medical Council. Practitioners are required to abide by the code of conduct of their professional body. They must keep up-to-date in both their conventional and homeopathic training and practice, in order to retain their membership of the Faculty of Homeopathy.
