#### About the clinic

The BHA Edinburgh homeopathy clinic, run by Karen Hooton opened its doors on 6th October 2017. The clinic is a charitably run clinic which offers free homeopathic consultations at Mulberry House, in the centre of Edinburgh. Although patients are not charged, they are encouraged to make donations towards their treatment. All donations go directly to the clinic. BHA hopes that this support will continue to grow to help to ensure the homeopathy clinic serves the people of Edinburgh for many years to come.
