#### About the clinic

The British Homeopathic Association (BHA) is currently funding a homeopathy clinic in York. The clinic is run by Dr Charlotte Batchelor who is trained in homeopathic medicine and is a member of the Faculty of Homeopathy. She manages the service on the BHA’s behalf. Dr Batchelor has been running her own private homeopathic and nutritional practice for the past five years.

The clinic is run on a charitable basis. Although patients are not charged, they are encouraged to make donations towards their treatment.  All donations go directly to the clinic. The generosity of supporters makes a valuable contribution towards the running costs of the clinic, and the BHA hopes that this support will continue to grow to help to ensure the homeopathy clinic serves the people of York for many years to come.

The BHA York Homeopathic Clinic is open _two mornings per month_.

The clinic is at The Best Foot Forward Clinic in the village of Wigginton, five miles north of York city centre, or five minutes from the main ringroad around York. We have free parking and the clinic is wheelchair accessible.
