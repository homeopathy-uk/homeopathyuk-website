#### About the clinic

Our Medical Doctor, Domnita Neagu delivers low-cost and private consultations from a central Bath location. The clinics are supported by the British Homeopathic Association (BHA), a registered charity that promotes the health benefits of Homeopathy and works to ensure the public has increased access to the therapy.

The British Homeopathic Association has worked with [Portland Centre for Integrative Medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/) to deliver two Bath Homeopathy clinics.

#### Who delivers the Bath Homeopathy clinics?

Our team of Medical Homeopathic Doctors are all members of the Faculty of Homeopathy. This is the registering body for statutorily regulated healthcare professionals who use Homeopathy in their clinical practice.

Our Doctors are also fully trained in conventional and complementary medicine. This means they will always consider all medical avenues for their patients, and apply their knowledge using an Integrative Medicine model.

The medical doctor providing these clinics is Dr Domnita Neagu, who is a member of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of General Practitioners. Dr Neagu also works as a GP within the city. You can find out more about her qualifications here.
