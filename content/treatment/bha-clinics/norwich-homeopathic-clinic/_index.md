#### About the clinic

The British Homeopathic Association (BHA) has funded a homeopathy clinic in Norwich since 2011. Formerly managed by Dr Katalin Borbely who left the area in Spring 2019, the clinic will reopen on Thursday 25th of April 2019 under the stewardship of Dr Michel Raggoo.

The clinic is based at The Rowan House Centre in the village of Hethersett, six miles from Norwich. Rowan House is a centre for complementary health offering a wide range of therapies and is well served by the local bus service.

Originally funded by a generous legacy made to the BHA, the clinic is run on a charitable basis. Although patients are not charged, they are encouraged to make donations towards their treatment.  All donations go directly to the clinic. The generosity of supporters has made a valuable contribution towards the running costs of the clinic over the last four years, and the BHA hopes that this support will continue to grow to help to ensure the homeopathy clinic serves the people of Norwich for many years to come.

#### Patient testimonials

Since the clinic opened four years ago patient numbers have steadily increased year on year, with patient feedback being very positive. Here is what a few of them have said:

<blockquote>After my first appointment I feel very positive. I am grateful to have someone look at the whole picture, not just the external signal.”
**HB**</blockquote>

<blockquote>I was impressed with Dr Borbely’s ability to explain symptoms in a concise way, which really helped me to visualise both the problem and the solution. This must be the way forward for the NHS.”
**AM**</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was a truly remarkable and pleasant experience.”
**JW**</blockquote>
