The Department of Health has confirmed that doctors can refer a patient for homeopathic treatment within the NHS.

#### Local funding decisions

Patients do not have an absolute right to any treatment on the NHS (including homeopathy), as clinical and funding judgements are always made before patients are referred to particular services. NHS Trusts are responsible for making decisions about the funding of the NHS locally.

#### Public meetings

The boards of Primary Care Trusts are required to hold their meetings in public and to take the views of local people into account. Many boards give members of the public an opportunity to ask questions and make comments at their meetings.
