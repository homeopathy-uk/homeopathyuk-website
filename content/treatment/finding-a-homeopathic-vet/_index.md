![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/homeopathic-vet.jpg)There are a number of vets who incorporate homeopathy into their everyday practice. Use our [practitioner search](http://localhost/treatment/find-a-homeopath-search/) to find one near you.

#### Should I inform my existing vet?

Most homeopathic vets ask new patients to contact the veterinary surgeon with whom their pets are registered for permission to provide a homeopathic consultation and treatment. When asking for an appointment you should check if this is the case.

#### Other vets trained in homeopathy

In addition to our list, the British Association of Homoeopathic Veterinary Surgeons (BAHVS) provides a list of vets trained in homeopathy. Some BAHVS vets have gained the Faculty of Homeopathyâ€™s veterinary qualifications VetMFHom or VetFFHom. [Visit the BAHVS website](http://www.bahvs.com/find-a-vet/).
