#### Complaint about NHS services

You have the right to have any complaint about NHS services investigated and to receive a full and prompt written reply. Who you complain to will depend on the nature of your complaint. Your local health authority can advise you and guide you through the procedure, find your local health authority via one of the following links:

[NHS Choices (England)](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx)
[NHS Northern Ireland](http://www.hscni.net/)
[NHS Scotland](http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/)
[NHS Wales](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/)

If a doctor behaves unethically or unprofessionally you can complain to the General Medical Council:

#### Complaint about a Faculty of Homeopathy member

The Faculty of Homeopathy has a Disciplinary and Professional Performance Procedure for its members. If you are dissatisfied with the quality of homeopathic treatment that you receive and are unable to resolve the matter with the practitioner concerned, please send your complaint in writing to:

Professional Performance Committee

#### Complaints about non Faculty members

The other three registering bodies also operate  their own professional standards and disciplinary procedures.  If you are dissatisfied with the quality of homeopathic treatment you have received from a homeopath belonging to one of these  organisations you should contact the relevant registering body.
