**History**

The notion of ‘like cures like’ can be traced back to the Greek physician, Hippocrates (460-377BC), who also placed great importance on the idea of treating each patient as an individual. However**,** it was not until the late 18th century that the two ideas were combined to create the system of medicine that we know as homeopathy.

**Samuel Hahnemann**

Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) was a German doctor who became dissatisfied with the medical practices of his time. These included blood-letting, purging and the prescribing of toxic substances like arsenic and lead. While investigating the effects of such substances on a healthy body he discovered that an illness could be treated with a very small amount of a substance that, in larger quantities, could cause that illness.

To avoid harmful side effects, he diluted each medicine until he reached the greatest dilution that would still produce a response. These experiments were called provings and led him to devise the basic principles of homeopathic medicine.
