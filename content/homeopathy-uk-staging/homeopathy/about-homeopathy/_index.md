**What is homeopathy?**

Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200 million people worldwide to treat both acute and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of ‘like cures like’. In other words, a substance taken in small amounts will cure the same symptoms it causes if taken in large amounts.

**What does homeopathic treatment involve?**

Homeopathy is concerned with the whole person. A homeopath will be interested in how you feel emotionally as well as your physical symptoms. They will discuss your lifestyle, medical history and state of mind before prescribing the appropriate homeopathic medicine.

**What are homeopathic medicines made of?**

Homeopathic medicines are made from small amounts of natural substances such as plants and minerals. Prepared in licensed laboratories, under strict control, they are usually taken as a tablet but are also available as liquids, powder or creams.

**Is homeopathy safe?**

Homeopathy has been practiced worldwide for over 250 years. It is gentle and rarely causes side effects. This means it is suitable for adults, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
