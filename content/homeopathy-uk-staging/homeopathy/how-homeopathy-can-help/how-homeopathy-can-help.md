**What is homeopathy used for?**

Patients with a wide range of illnesses report an improvement after taking homeopathic remedies. Homeopathic doctors often work with patients to treat eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoarthritis, anxiety attacks, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopausal symptoms. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments. A GP trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.
