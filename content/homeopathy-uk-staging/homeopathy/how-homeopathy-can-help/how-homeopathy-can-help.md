**Long-term problems**

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine, such as arthritis, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments. 

However, as a system of medicine homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can therefore be considered in almost any situation where a person’s health is depleted. 

**Minor ailments**  

It can also be very useful in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.

**Doctors, dentists, vets…**

As well as doctors there are nurses, midwives, dentists, vets, pharmacists, podiatrists and osteopaths, all using homeopathy in their daily practice.
