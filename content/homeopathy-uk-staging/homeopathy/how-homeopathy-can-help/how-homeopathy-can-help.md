**Long-term problems**

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine, such as arthritis, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments. A GP trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.
