**Long-term problems**

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine, such as arthritis, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments. 

However, as a system of medicine homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can therefore be considered in almost any situation where a personâ€™s health is depleted. 

**Minor ailments**  

It can also be very useful in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.

As well as doctors there are nurses, midwives, dentists, vets, pharmacists, podiatrists and osteopaths, all using homeopathy in their daily practice.

**Helping pets**

One of the interesting things about homeopathy is that it can have great results in animals. Sceptics often use the argument that homeopathic treatment works because it is all in the mind of the patient. It would be hard to apply this argument to your pet cat or dog!
