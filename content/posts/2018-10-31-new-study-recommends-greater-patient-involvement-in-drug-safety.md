A new report by the University of Seville and the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, Lareb, highlights the importance of patient organisations in ensuring safe medical treatment. The British Homeopathic Association was amongst a group of European patient organisations invited to contribute to the study which took place in March and April 2018. The resulting paper, “The Role of European Patient Organizations in Pharmacovigilance”, recognises the crucial role played by patient organisations in encouraging patients to alert medical professionals to any adverse effects of drugs. The report also recommends that drug safety groups work more closely with patient organisations to raise awareness of harmful drugs. **Cristal Sumner**, **Chief Executive of the British Homeopathic Association** said:

<blockquote>We welcome this report and hope it will help empower patients to take an active role in their treatment. The homeopathic approach embraces this and encourages healthcare professionals to listen to patients and work with the organisations that represent them.
