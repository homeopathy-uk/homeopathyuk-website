Congratulations
to our patron, Twiggy, who received a damehood in Her Majesty the Queen’s 2019 New
Year’s Honours list. The model, actress and singer, whose real name is Lesley
Lawson, was awarded the DBE for services to fashion, the arts and charity.

Twiggy shot to worldwide fame as a model during the 1960s before embarking upon an acting career which earned her two Golden Globe awards (for her role in the film musical, ‘The Boyfriend’) and a Tony nomination (best actress in a musical for the Broadway production of ‘My One and Only’).  Reacting to the New Year’s Honours announcement, Twiggy said, ‘It’s wonderful but it makes me giggle. The hardest thing has been keeping it a secret’.
