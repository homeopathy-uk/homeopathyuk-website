Thank you to everyone who responded to the NHS England consultation and got involved in our campaign: _[Save Homeopathy and Herbal Medicine](http://localhost/bha-blog/save-homeopathy-herbal-medicine/)_.

As you know, the BHA has--from the outset--questioned the legality of the NHS England consultation which closed on the 21st October. In July, NHS England announced it was consulting on removing 18 treatments from primary care prescribing, including homeopathy. The consultation ended in October and a report will be considered by the NHS England board on 30 November.

We need to maintain the pressure during this critical time, to make decision-makers aware of the issues and inconsistencies which plague the consultation and its process.

MPs need to be aware that NHS England is basing its decisions on a fundamentally flawed report which is not peer-reviewed evidence.  Please write to your MP to make them aware of the issues and your concerns. To help create a letter we have provided some helpful information. Read through the points in our [template letter](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/NHS-England-Consultation-letter-to-MPs.docx), and please write in your own style to help ensure it is opened and read.

Over 20,000 people have now signed our parliamentary petition--[Stop NHS England from removing herbal and homeopathic medicines](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200154)--letting the government know that homeopathy should not have been part of the consultation. Keep sharing so we can have a stronger voice in representing patients and the public.

The BHA believes NHS England failed to meet its statutory duty in the way it conducted the consultation and will be sharing important news Monday about critical work being done to defend homeopathy and make NHS England accountable to the public it is supposed to serve.
