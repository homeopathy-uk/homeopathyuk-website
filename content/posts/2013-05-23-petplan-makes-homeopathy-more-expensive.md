One of the UK’s largest pet insurance providers, Petplan, has applied an additional excess to claims for complementary therapies like homeopathy and acupuncture.  From 1 April 2009 pet owners pay an additional £75 for a dog, £60 for a cat and £50 for a rabbit in order to access homeopathic treatment under the policy changes. If you are adversely affected by this decision write to Petplan to let them know you are unhappy – [contact details can be found on their website](http://www.petplan.co.uk/contactus/contactus.asp).
