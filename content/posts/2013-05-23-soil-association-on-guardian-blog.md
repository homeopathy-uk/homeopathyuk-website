It's Organic Fortnight, and the [Soil Association](http://www.soilassociation.org/) are taking questions on the Guardian's Green Living blog all this week.

Organic food, clothing and the use of homeopathy in farming are some of the subjects likely to crop up. Go to [You Ask, They Answer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2009/sep/07/soil-association?commentpage=1&commentposted=1) to ask questions or post your thoughts.
