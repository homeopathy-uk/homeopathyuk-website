**The NHS is slowly dismantling our healthcare choices without proper and lawful consultation.**

The BHA has commenced an application for judicial review on the basis that the NHS England Consultation on _[Items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care](https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/items-routinely-prescribed/)_ was fundamentally flawed from the outset, in that the proposal was not formulated with input from any homeopathy experts or practitioners; it was not a genuine attempt to engage consultees (a decision having been ostensibly predetermined) and did not provide consultees with adequate information on which to provide a considered and informed response.

The judicial review seeks, among other things, a declaration that NHS England has acted unlawfully in relation to its proposals, its failure to consult on them properly and to listen to patients! If successful, we can protect the right of patients to choose to be treated with homeopathy on the NHS and the right of the public to properly have input on the services that their National Health Service provides. We have engaged solicitors Bates Wells Braithwaite, led by Emma Dowden-Teale, recognised for their expertise in judicial review and a highly regarded QC—Richard Clayton QC—who has an outstanding track record in cases involving public policy. We want to raise £16,000 to cover part of the legal fees for our judicial review. Once we reach this target, more funds will ensure the legal challenge can proceed.

Your support will help make NHS England more accountable, defend patient choice and, more importantly, ensure patients have appropriate input on their access to cost-effective healthcare they use and need—in this case HOMEOPATHY!

Help the BHA defend patients’ rights by donating toward our legal fees. Thank you.
