_Dr Katalin Borbely is embarking on a marathon walk to raise funds for the British Homeopathic Association (BHA). The doctor, who runs the BHA funded clinic in Norwich, is setting off on 29 March from the Spanish city of Leon to walk 220 miles to the shrine at Santiago de Compostela, the reputed burial place of James the Great, one of Christ’s apostles._

The long, arduous trek will see her follow the same route that has been taken by Christian pilgrims for centuries and which is also known as the Way of St James.

Katalin is planning to walk up to 20 miles a day, depending on the terrain, and hopes to complete her marathon walk in two weeks. In preparation for her gruelling challenge she has been working with her friend Claire Thomson, a personal trainer and former 2012 Olympic torch bearer.

“Although I used to be a runner and am quite fit, I do need some special preparations as I broke my vertebrae and some bones in a car accident in 1999,” says Katalin. “I will also make sure I have a selection of homeopathic remedies with me in the event I suffer from any aches, strains or bruises.”
