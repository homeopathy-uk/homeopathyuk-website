**18 February 2011**

Homeopathy is a relatively safe, inexpensive and effective treatment for many conditions, including chronic and multiple pathologies. Many PCTs are still funding it because it is popular with patients and provides a cost effective alternative when conventional treatments have failed.

There are over 100 clinical trials in homeopathy of which far more are positive than negative as well as good outcome studies from the homeopathic hospitals. Millions of people use it worldwide and it is an integral part of the health systems in France and Germany.

The public should ask themselves why there is so much attention given to homeopathy which costs so little and helps so many while costly interventions which have been shown not to work such as SSRI's for mild to moderate depression seem to continue with little outrage at a cost of over Â£200 million a year.
