As part of our [Save Homeopathy and Herbal medicines campaign](http://localhost/bha-blog/save-homeopathy-herbal-medicine/), we know from feedback that the consultation response portal on NHS England’s website is not very helpful and is actually obstructive in easily providing feedback. Many questions are optional, meaning you can skip to the questions you want to answer or feel confident in responding to.

Once on the website ([NHS England: Items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care](https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/items-routinely-prescribed/consultation/intro/)):

**Page 1:** You will be asked for your name and email address, you can choose to remain anonymous but if you feel comfortable it is best to be a named individual or organisation.

**Page 2:** Is an equalities and health inequalities question--if you feel certain groups of people are at risk or disadvantaged from the cuts proposed, please specify or  just move on to the next question.

**Page 3:** Is a question about evidence for potential impact on health inequalities. Again, answer if you feel you’d like to or skip to next question.

**Page 4:** Asks about the proposed process for identification of items for removal.  If you can provide views please do so or skip to the next question.

**Page 5:** Select ‘Yes’ in response to “Do you want to provide views on the proposals for CCG commissioning guidance?”, and select homeopathy from the list. You have the opportunity later to add comments on other treatments if you wish.

**Page 6:** You’re now asked, in two questions, if you agree that there should be no new homeopathy prescriptions, and if you agree that those currently receiving homeopathy should be transferred to a different treatment and the prescription ended.

You can select:
o	Agree
o	Neither disagree or agree
o	Disagree
o	Unsure

By selecting disagree you are letting NHS England know you would like to keep homeopathy in the NHS.

You also have the option to provide a further comment on your answer, or on the availability of homeopathy on prescription in general. Remember, some of your comments may be anonymised and published as part of the consultation outcome, so please make sure any comments are respectful and relevant to the consultation.

If you’d like to leave comments on another treatment, you can select it from the list below such a herbal treatments; otherwise, select “I would not like to provide further feedback on any more of these medicines”.

The rest of the questions are self-explanatory and optional.
