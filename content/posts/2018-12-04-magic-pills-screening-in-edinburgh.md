_“Magic Pills : Promise or Placebo”_ is a unique documentary film exploring the arguments for and against homeopathy. It follows Canadian homeopath, Ananda More, as she travels the world to meet with homeopathy practitioners, patients, scientists and sceptics.

We see how homeopathy is being used to treat cancer in India, support the use of antiretroviral medication for HIV/AIDS in Africa and prevent common epidemics in Cuba.

The British Homeopathic Association will host a special screening of _Magic Pills_ in Edinburgh on _Saturday 23 March 2019 _at _2.30pm_.

The venue is _St Andrew's & St George’s West Church, 13 George Street, Edinburgh EH2 2PA_.
