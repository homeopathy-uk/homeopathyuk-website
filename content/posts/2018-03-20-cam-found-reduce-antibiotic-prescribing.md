The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in primary care may help significantly reduce the prescribing of antibiotics, according to new research [published in BMJ Open](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e020488).

Health experts have identified the overprescribing of antibiotics as a leading cause of antimicrobial resistance, which has become one of the main threats to public health. In the UK, 74% of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care and the NHS is seeking ways to cut their use.

Researchers led by the University of Bristol collected data from over 7,000 GP surgeries and compared it with nine surgeries where the GPs integrated CAM in their daily practice. Analysis showed that practices that employed GPs with additional training in complementary therapies, such as homeopathy and herbal medicine, prescribed 22% fewer antibiotics.

Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association, said:

<blockquote>This study supports what the BHA has been saying for some time. Homeopathy and other complementary therapies can play a part in cutting the number of costly conventional drugs prescribed by GPs, which is in line with NHS policy.</blockquote>
