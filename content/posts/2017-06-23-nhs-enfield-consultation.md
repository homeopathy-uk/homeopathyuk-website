**Enfield CCG consultation**

NHS Enfield Clinical Commissioning Group is currently consulting the public and patients on its proposal to cease funding for homeopathy. They say this will allow them to use valuable resources for evidence-based treatments. However, in its consultation document the CCG concedes homeopathy is only provided to “very few patients in Enfield”, so the resources they are using are minimal  while the health benefits of homeopathic treatment  to this  small  group of patients are considerable. There is no mention of the alternative treatments, including cost, that the CCG plans to make available to these patients should  this proposal be approved.

Also, it seems strange that a CCG committed to targeting resources at evidence-based medicine is not consulting on whether to remove  funding for SSRIs for the treatment of mild depression. These drugs  cost the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds a year despite many experts claiming they are ineffective for this condition.  The CCG also seems to have overlooked the BMJ’s Evidence Check which found only 11% of treatments  to have “known effectiveness”. If Enfield CCG were to apply the  same rigid criteria  for evidence-based medicine it is using in respect of homeopathy  to all NHS treatments, clearly doctors  would  have very few clinical options available to them.

If you support the right of patients in Enfield to continue to receive the benefits of safe, cost-effective  homeopathic treatment, please take  part in the  public consultation.

The deadline for the NHS Enfield Consultation is 30 June 2017.
