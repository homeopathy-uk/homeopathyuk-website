We have one week to go until our judicial review hearing on 1st May against NHS England and everything is ramping up for the big day(s). The final arguments for our case have been sent to the court and we have received NHS England's arguments in defence of their position too.

The court will hear arguments from the BHA's QC Richard Clayton (instructed and supported by Emma Dowden-Teale's team at Bates Wells Braithwaite) detailing why we consider that NHS England's consultation to remove funding for homeopathic medicines in primary care was so flawed it was unlawful.

Our legal team has been working tirelessly to prepare for the hearing and we great are confident the substantive grounds on which the BHA’s application for judicial review is based will lead to success.

We are edging closer to our initial target of £10,000 to help the BHA fund this legal work. It would be fantastic to meet or exceed that target by the 1st May. Please help make that happen by sharing this update or creating a link to this page to help spread the word. This case isn't just about homeopathy, it is about the NHS doing its job properly, for us, its customers! It needs to engage with us properly and lawfully before making important decisions in relation to available care which impacts on people's day-to-day lives.

Thanks again for your support!!

Cristal Sumner, BHA Chief Executive
