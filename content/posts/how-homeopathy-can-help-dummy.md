**How homeopathy can help**

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine. Homeopathy has been successfully used to treat a range of illnesses and conditions including: eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoarthritis, anxiety attacks, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopausal symptoms. It can also be effective in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments.

However, since homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person it can be considered in almost any situation where a personâ€™s health is depleted.

Despite the differences in approach, homeopathic and conventional treatments can work very well alongside each other. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both. Our Homeopathy UK charitable clinics {LINK TO CLINICS PAGE} are staffed by GPs and medical professionals trained in homeopathy bringing patients the best of both worlds. You can also find details of other registered homeopaths across the UK by using our FindAHomeopath search tool {LINK TO FIND A HOMEOPATH PAGE}
