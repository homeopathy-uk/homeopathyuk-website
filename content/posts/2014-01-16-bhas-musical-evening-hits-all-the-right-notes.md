_Homeopathy is often described as the healing art, so it was fitting that music was central to the BHA’s first fundraising event in several years, which took place in mid-November. The aim, of course, was to raise funds for the BHA, but at the same time we wanted to promote greater awareness of homeopathy and have some fun._

The BHA is currently planning a range of fundraising events, and the musical evening was very much a trial event to gauge its popularity with a view to holding similar events across the UK. Therefore a venue local to where the BHA’s offices are based in Luton was chosen, but even so people travelled from London, Birmingham and Leicester to attend.

At the beginning of the evening the BHA’s Chief Executive, Cristal Sumner, welcomed everyone and explained a little about the BHA and its aims.

The musical entertainment was provided by local singer Gary Williams. He immediately got everyone in the party spirit with his excellent renditions of songs by Elvis, UB40, Buddy Holly and Neil Diamond, to name but a few. The dance floor was full all night, with many people displaying some pretty impressive dance moves as they gyrated, shimmied and syncopated to timeless classics such as _Sweet Caroline_, _Stuck In The Middle With You_ and _Can’t Help Falling In Love_.

A delicious buffet was served and there was also a raffle which was generously supported. Lucky winners went away with a selection of prizes including wine, whisky, chocolates and that must-have fashion item for 2014, the BHA T-shirt* (have you got yours yet?).

Everyone had a fantastic time and we succeeded in raising a total of £235. Not bad for a first effort! News of future BHA fundraising events will be appearing on this website and in the BHA’s magazine _Health and Homeopathy_.
