![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Save-homeopathy-for-animals-logo-292x300.jpg)Vets using homeopathy are not putting animals at risk, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

DEFRA was responding to a parliamentary question tabled by David Tredinnick MP, who has taken up the cause of vets unhappy at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons’ (RCVS) position statement on complementary and alternative medicines that they say effectively prevents them from using a therapy that benefits animal health.

In his written answer the Secretary of State, George Eustice MP, was unequivocal: “The Department does not have any evidence that shows that homeopathic vets are a risk to animal welfare by using homeopathy as an alternative treatment to conventional medicine options.”

Peter Gregory, veterinary dean of the Faculty of Homeopathy, said: “This drives a coach and horses through the Royal College’s reasoning for adopting its anti-homeopathy stance. The argument that homeopathy endangers animal health is spurious, unsubstantiated and wrong.”

He continued: “Growing numbers of pet owners and farmers are seeking a more holistic approach to animal health and have found homeopathy can help to achieve this. In light of the Secretary of State’s statement, I call on the Royal College to look again at its position on the use of complementary medicines in veterinary practice.”

More than 18,000 people have signed an online petition in support of veterinary homeopathy since the RCVS announced its new position statement in November, and a demonstration organised by the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons is taking place in London on 16 April.
