It is with a heavy heart that we share the news that our colleague Dr Peter Fisher FRCP FFHom died on Wednesday 15th August in a tragic cycling accident in London. Dr Fisher was a trustee of the British Homeopathic Association, President of the Faculty of Homeopathy, Editor of Homeopathy, and the Queen’s Homeopathic Physician. He held many other posts and positions and reflects his stature in the medical, scientific and homeopathic communities. It is a great blow to have lost one of our leading lights. Our thoughts and sincere condolences go his family and loved ones at this time.

The Faculty of Homeopathy’s [statement on Dr Fisher’s death is here](https://facultyofhomeopathy.org/statement-on-the-death-of-dr-peter-fisher-president-of-the-faculty-of-homeopathy/).

The news of his death was covered in many newspapers. [The Evening Standard's](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/doctor-to-the-queen-peter-fisher-killed-after-being-hit-by-lorry-while-cycling-in-holborn-a3912801.html) was one of the best.

And here is one small video of Peter’s speaking on [why he decided to become a homeopath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quam9XT6GOo).
