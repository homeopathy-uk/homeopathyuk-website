![Release the First Report - Show Australia the world is watching](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Show-Australia-the-world-is-watching-1024x512.png)

In 2015, the Australian Government research Institute, NHMRC published a study **‘Evidence on the Effectiveness of Homeopathy for Treating Health Conditions’**. The paper, which made headlines around the world, recommended that “homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious”. It has subsequently **been used as scientific proof that homeopathy doesn’t work.**

What has not been widely reported is that the study has a number of substantial flaws and fails to comply with accepted scientific methodology. Crucially, the 2015 study was preceded by a 2012 report containing positive conclusions about homeopathy and never published.

People across the world are joining the movement calling for the release of the first NHMRC Homeopathy Report. Find out more and sign the petition to **[RELEASE THE FIRST REPORT](https://releasethefirstreport.com/).**
