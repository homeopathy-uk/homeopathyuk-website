Vaccinations for infectious childhood diseases is currently a major news story.

There is no evidence to suggest that the measles outbreak in Swansea or the fall-off in MMR vaccinations in the Totnes area are as a result of people choosing to use complementary medicines instead of conventional immunisation. However, we would like to state that on the issue of immunisation the BHA has for many years taken an unequivocal position.

In line with the Department of Healthâ€™s advice, the BHA recommends that immunisation should be carried out in the normal way using the conventional tested and approved vaccines.
