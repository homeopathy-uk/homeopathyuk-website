Family, friends and colleagues from around the world, gathered in London yesterday to remember Dr Peter Fisher, the late director of research at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM) and homeopathic physician to the Queen.

St Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar Square, was the setting for an afternoon of readings, music and personal recollections. Amongst those paying tribute were Peter’s partner, daughters and several life-long friends.

The 300 strong congregation also heard reminiscences from Dr Michael Dixon, Chair of the College of Medicine, Dr Sara Eames and Dr Sosie Kassab from the RLHIM. The actress, Diana Quick, gave a reading while Rachel Purtell, a former patient of Dr Fisher, shared how his treatment had transformed her life and health.

Music came from The Massive Violins (a cello group including RLHIM consultant, Dr Saul Berkovitz), the St Martin’s Voices choir and organist Ben Giddens. The church bells were rung by the Guild of Medical Ringers.

Guests included representatives of Her Majesty the Queen, The Prince of Wales and British Homeopathic Association CEO, Cristal Sumner, representing our Royal Patron, The Duke of Gloucester.
