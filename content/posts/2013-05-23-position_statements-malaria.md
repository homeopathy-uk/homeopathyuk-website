**The BHA follows the advice of the Faculty of Homeopathy on malaria. See below:**

The Faculty of Homeopathy, the professional body for doctors and other statutorily regulated healthcare professionals who integrate homeopathy into their practice, does not promote the use of homeopathy for the prevention of malaria.

It also supports steps to inform the public of the dangers of malaria and the need to follow government guidance. In 2005 the Faculty worked with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on a statement for the HPA website: [www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/homeopathic_statement_260705.htm](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/homeopathic_statement_260705.htm) (archived webpage).

“Malaria is a serious and life-threatening disease and there is no published evidence to support the use of homeopathy in the prevention of malaria,” comments Dr Peter Fisher, a member of the Faculty of Homeopathy and Clinical Director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital. “The Faculty of Homeopathy recommends following the HPA guidelines.”
