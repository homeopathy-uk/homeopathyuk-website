_After taking on a new role at the British Homeopathic Association as Fundraising Manager, I thought I’d better have a think about what I could do to raise some funds for the BHA myself._

It seemed like a good opportunity to try out the newly designed fundraising pack, so that’s where I began. It was easy to follow and I soon narrowed my options down to three. Eventually I decided I would abandon my car and cycle to work for the whole of the month of August, whatever the weather! This would involve a daily round trip of eight miles, which means over the month I would cycle a total of 176 miles.

As I had not cycled regularly since I was a teenager I thought I had better do some training, so every weekend – and some evenings – I was out on my bike to prepare for my challenge.

Before I knew it, August had arrived. At first I was apprehensive about cycling through the rush-hour traffic and more than a little relieved when I was safely home with the first day done. After that, I really began to enjoy it. There’s something very satisfying about cycling past a queue of slow moving or stalled traffic!

The month didn’t pass without event: the hottest day for 10 years, a torrential thunderstorm and various obstacles including jaywalking pedestrians and inconsiderate drivers, in addition to being plagued by a swarm of insects.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, got a bit fitter and felt like I had achieved something. More importantly, I raised a total of £884 for the BHA, so that made it even more worthwhile.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who sponsored me on my cycle challenge. And if you were thinking of making a donation but didn’t get around to it, it’s not too late.
