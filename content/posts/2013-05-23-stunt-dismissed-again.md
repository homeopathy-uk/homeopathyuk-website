**7 February 2011**

For the second year running 10.23 demonstrated their ignorance and irresponsibility by trying to stage a mass overdose. It also shows that the participants have no understanding of how to select and use homeopathic medicines in an appropriate manner.

Homeopathy works. There are well over 100 double blind trials in homeopathy and more are positive than negative. In a study over 70% of patients treated at an NHS Homeopathic Hospital reported improved health.

While the British Homeopathic Association and Faculty of Homeopathy are ready to engage in serious discourse, 10.23 are more interested in staging irresponsible publicity stunts that makes light of the seriousness of overdosing on drugs ratherÂ than finding out why homeopathy works.
