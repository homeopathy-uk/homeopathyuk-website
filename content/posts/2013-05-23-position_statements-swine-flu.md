**The BHA follows the advice of the Faculty of Homeopathy on swine flu:**

The Faculty of Homeopathy supports the Department of Health in its approach to a possible pandemic of swine influenza A(H1N1).

Key in this approach is to prevent the spread of infection by

  * Ensuring you wash your hands regularly with soap and water

  * Regularly cleaning surfaces, including door handles, to remove contamination

  * Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneezing

  * Placing used tissues in a bin as soon as possible.

  * If you fear you may have swine flu contact your GP or NHS Direct immediately.

Homeopathy has a place in assisting the body to heal and lessen the symptoms.
