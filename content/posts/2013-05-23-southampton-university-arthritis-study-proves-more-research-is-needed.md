This trial, which appeared in Rheumatology, provides some evidence that homeopathy can be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, even if from secondary outcomes only.  However, three important factors undermine the quality of the trial: the number of patients studied, the effectiveness of the Rheumaselect and the unknown experience of the prescribers in the homeopathic treatment of arthritis patients.

The only conclusion that can be drawn from this trial is there is some evidence that homeopathy can be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Taking into account the trial’s shortcomings which are highlighted above, it’s not possible to conclude - nor should it have been stated so emphatically be the authors of the paper- that the positive effects were due purely to the consultation. More research is clearly needed.
