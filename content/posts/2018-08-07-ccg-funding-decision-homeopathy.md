By removing homeopathic referrals to the Portland Centre for Integrated Medicine (PCIM), Bristol CCG demonstrates a lack of sound decision making because this change will not help improve patient health or balance their books. It will have a negative impact on the lives of those in the care of Bristol CCG as most of the referral patients have chronic conditions which have not been helped through the conventional treatment and now have to go back to treatments that do not work as well for them and cost more. The highly-rated, doctor led service at PCIM will continue to be available to paying patients but sadly will now be unavailable to those without funds and often in most need who were being helped through the referral service.
