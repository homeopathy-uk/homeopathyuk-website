The British Homeopathic Association has launched a campaign which brings together ten well-known faces in support of today’s launch of Homeopathy Awareness Week, running every year from 14th – 21st June.

Exclusive photographs of celebrities including former model Jo Wood, TV personality Gaby Roslin, actress Louise Jameson, former professional tennis player Annabel Croft and British Olympic sprinter James Ellington who are convinced of the therapeutic value of homeopathy, have been revealed today. These celebrities regularly use homeopathic medicines such as arnica, lavender, sulphur, bellis perennis and pulsatilla for the treatment of every day complaints such as bruising, tension headaches, menopause related symptoms, exertion and coughs.

The British Homeopathic Association has taken an exclusive collection of themed images of each celebrity holding the source material of one of the homeopathic medicines that has helped them.
The British Homeopathic Association has existed for over 100 years and is working for greater integration of homeopathy into everyday healthcare. It aims to dispel the publicised myths surrounding homeopathy with facts and promote homeopathy’s very useful benefits to the public.

None of the celebrities involved were paid to take part in this campaign.
