In less than two weeks, [a parliamentary petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200154) calling on NHS England to [drop its proposal to ban doctors]/bha-blog/save-homeopathy-herbal-medicine/) from prescribing homeopathic and herbal medicines has been signed by 10,000 people. The  government is now required to give an official response*. Thank you for signing the petition and supporting the campaign to protect genuine patient choice in NHS healthcare provision.

Remember, the petition forms only one part of our campaign and together we can deliver an even more powerful message if each one of us responds to the NHS England consultation, [writes to our MP]/bha-blog/write-mp-nhs-consultation-homeopathy-herbal-medicines/) and shares news of the campaign with family, friends and colleagues.

Thank you again for your support!

* If the petition reaches 100,000 signatures it will be considered for debate in parliament – so if you haven’t signed yet, please do!
