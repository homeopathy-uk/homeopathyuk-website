Over 3,500 patients reported considerable improvements in various health conditions following homeopathic treatment, a recent eight year study published in [BMC Public Health](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/8/413) shows.

Data obtained from 103 homeopathic primary care practices in Germany and Switzerland showed that the severity of symptoms patients experienced decreased significantly during treatment.  One in two patients reported improvement of their symptoms by 50% or more.

Women, younger people, and those with more severe symptoms when they commenced treatment, had more success with their treatment overall. The most frequent conditions treated were allergic rhinitis, headache and eczema in adults, and atopic dermatitis, multiple recurrent infections and sleep disorders in children.
