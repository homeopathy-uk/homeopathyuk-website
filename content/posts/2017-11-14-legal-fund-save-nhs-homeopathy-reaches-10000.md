+++

The British Homeopathic Association’s (BHA) campaign to raise money to fund a judicial review of NHS England’s plan to stop GPs prescribing homeopathy has reached  £10,000 in  just seven days.

Cristal Sumner, BHA chief executive, said:

<blockquote>We are overwhelmed at the level of financial support we’ve received and I would like to thank everyone for their donations. The BHA believes NHS England failed to consult properly and impartially on this important issue and so has taken the difficult decision to launch this legal challenge. But we are determined to defend NHS homeopathy and the right of patients to have their voices heard.</blockquote>
