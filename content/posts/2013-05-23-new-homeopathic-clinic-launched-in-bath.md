Bristol Homeopathic Hospital has seen an increase in referrals for homeopathy in the past few months and has just opened a new outreach clinic in Bath to cater for patient demand.

Dr Domnita Neagu, who will run the clinic, says: “Patients are very appreciative of the integrated approach to care, combining the best of conventional and homeopathic medicine. In very many instances it has not only brought enormous relief but has also allowed them to enjoy life to the full.”

The clinic will see patients with a variety of illnesses including rheumatic conditions, alle[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Liz-Thompson-cv-image-199x300.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Liz-Thompson-cv-image.jpg)rgies and digestive problems. It will also offer support to cancer sufferers.

Consultant Homeopathic Physician at Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, Elizabeth Thompson (pictured right), comments: “This new outreach clinic will mean that patients from the local community will be able to access a wide range of treatments nearer to their homes.”

Bristol Homeopathic Hospital carried out one of the most comprehensive patient outcome surveys between 1997 and 2003, analysing over 23,000 outpatient consultations. This represented over 6,500 individual patients. More than 70% of these follow-up patients recorded clinical improvement following homeopathic treatment.
