NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed this week that it will continue funding Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital.

A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said that the administration recognises that complementary or alternative therapies may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide range of conditions.

The good news came in the wake of the furore unleashed by the Science and Technology Committee's flawed report published this week which called for a halt to NHS funding for homeopathy.

Dr Bob Leckridge of the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital said he was disappointed by the report and he described it as naive and simplistic.

Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association, said: 'I am delighted that the NHS has decided to continue homeopathy funding in Glasgow.'

However, she added: 'One should keep in mind the Science and Technology report is from only four MPs, one of whom dissented. It seems a dysfunctional way to govern if the suggestions from three MPS can possibly determine the health and welfare of thousands of patients, after a cursory review, which consisted of a few hours of oral testimony and a few dozen 3,000 word written submissions.'
