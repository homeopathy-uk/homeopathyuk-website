A German research group that studied 134 adults with sinusitis found that patients reported a better quality of life after being treated by homeopathic doctors. The improvements were still present when the patients were followed up after eight years.1

Nearly all of the patients (97%) had previously been treated with conventional medicine and had suffered with sinusitis for ten years, on average.

The authors of the study stress that further investigation is needed to clarify to what extent the observed effects are due to lifestyle or other factors associated with the treatment.

Nevertheless, these observations of homeopathy in everyday practice support existing clinical research - there are [three positive randomised controlled trials in sinusitis](http://localhost/evidence/conditions-with-overall-positive-evidence-for-homeopathy/) and a [positive systematic review in upper respiratory tract infections](http://localhost/export/sites/bha_site/research/evidencesummary.pdf).
