A Nobel prize winner will be among scientists attending an international seminar in London this summer to discuss the latest groundbreaking research into the properties of water.

Leading researchers from Europe and the US will be exploring “New Horizons in Water Science - the evidence for homeopathy” at No 1, Wimpole Street home of the Royal Society of Medicine, in London on Saturday 14 July 2018. The seminar is open to the public and tickets cost £95.

Among those attending is Nobel laureate, Emeritus Prof Brian Josephson, Cambridge University. In 1973, Prof Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in quantum tunnelling which is the phenomenon where a particle tunnels through a barrier that it classically cannot surmount. He has also expressed support for the “memory of water” theory advanced by the French immunologist Jacques Benveniste, which some believe could explain the method of action of homeopathic medicines.

Travelling from America is Honorary Prof Gerald Pollack of the University of Washington. A professor in bioengineering and an expert in water science, Prof Pollack discovered the fourth phase of water known as EZ water.

Completing an impressive international line-up are two Russian scientists – Prof Vladimir Voeikov and Prof Alexander Konovalov. Prof Voeikov is renowned in the field of physical and chemical properties of aqueous systems and their key role in the vital processes in living systems; while Prof Konovalov has conducted independent research on high dilutions that could provide a better scientific understanding of homeopathy.

An honorary dinner for the visiting scientists will take place at the House of Lords on Friday 13 July to which the public is also invited.
