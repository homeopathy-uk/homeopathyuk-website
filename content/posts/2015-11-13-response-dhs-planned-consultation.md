_In response to news reports that the Department of Health is planning a consultation on whether to “blacklist” homeopathic medicines, the President of the Faculty of Homeopathy has issued the following statement:_

<blockquote>
It’s disappointing that at a time when the NHS is facing a funding crisis the Department of Health (DH) is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year. If the DH were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at SSRIs, prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the NHS, but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions?
