A ground-breaking conference exploring the latest research into the properties of water is now available to watch on video for the first time. ‘New Horizons in Water Science’: Evidence for Homeopathy?’ took place at London’s Royal Society of Medicine on 14 July 2018 and included presentations by two Nobel Laureates: [Professor Luc Montagnier](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2008/montagnier/facts/) and [Professor Brian Josephson](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/).

Professor Montagnier – awarded a Nobel prize in Medicine in 2008 for the [co-discovery of HIV](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/10/nobel-prize-surprise) – shared a decade of research suggesting that the molecular machinery responsible for copying DNA does not require the presence of physical DNA but can also work from an ‘imprinted’ water template. Professor Josephson – the youngest ever winner of the Nobel prize for Physics in 1973 – explained his work demonstrating that water has a memory.

You can watch these talks together with those of [Prof. Jerry Pollack](https://www.pollacklab.org/jerry), [Prof. Vladimir Voiekov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladimir_Voeikov), and [Prof. Jayesh Bellare](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/online/faculty/jayesh-bellare) at the New Horizons in Water Science: Evidence for Homeopathy?” YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKyjPaSH0deBdoICS3_YMwA).
