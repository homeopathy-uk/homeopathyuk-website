Homeopathy Awareness Week (April 10th–16th) is the annual opportunity for all those whose lives have been touched by homeopathy to celebrate this remarkable and enduring treatment. This year, as ever, we will be raising awareness of the benefits of homeopathy and encouraging those who haven’t experienced it to try it for themselves.

## “The Cost of Health” survey

We have teamed up with 4Homeopathy colleagues to produce a special poll, “The Cost of Health”. The survey explores how much UK adults spend on staying healthy together with attitudes to fitness and wellbeing. Read the results of the survey and calculate how much you spend on health [here](http://findahomeopath.org/).
