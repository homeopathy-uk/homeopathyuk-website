We are extremely excited to launch ‘**10k 4** **BHA**’, a new ongoing initiative to raise funds for the British Homeopathic Association.

Two members of the BHA staff, Sacha El Masry and Tracey Simmons are the first to take up the **10k 4** **BHA** challenge and have both committed to walking ten thousand steps every single day this June – yes, even on the weekends! Training completed, their challenge is now under way.  You can keep abreast of their progress on our Facebook, Instagram & Twitter feeds.

The great thing about **10k 4** **BHA** is it’s completely flexible – you can do your own 10k whenever and however you wish. So, for example, you could decide to walk 10k steps for one day in September this year, you could choose a 10k run in April next year, or you could read 10K pages in the month of August, it’s entirely up to you. Because it’s an ongoing campaign, you choose when it’s best for you to take part. You could even decide to make it an annual event or do something that will really challenge you – something you’ve always wanted to do but never got around to!

If you would like to take part we’d love to hear about your challenge and help you get started, so please do get in touch by either emailing [donations@britishhomeopathic.org](mailto:donations@britishhomeopathic.org) or call us 020 3640 5903.

If you are unable to take part, but would like to make a donation, you can donate on the BHA website or call us on 020 3640 5903 to donate over the phone. Alternatively, post a cheque payable to: ‘British Homeopathic Association’ to:
