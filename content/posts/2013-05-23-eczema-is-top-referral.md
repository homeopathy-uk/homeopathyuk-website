A new study shows eczema is the most commonly referred condition to the NHS homeopathic hospitals.

Follow-up patients from all five NHS homeopathic hospitals were analysed over a one month period in 2007 in the first collaborative study of its kind.

Chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausal disorder, osteoarthritis and depression complete the 'top five' most referred conditions.

The study clearly shows that the medical problems referred to the hospitals are chronic conditions where available conventional treatments are not fully effective.

The NHS homeopathic hospitals play a vital role in filling these so-called "effectiveness gaps" in conventional medicine.

In total, the study identified 235 separate medical complaints; a third of follow-up patients reported an improvement after only two appointments. [Read full paper]/export/sites/bha_site/research/Five_hospital_study_2008.pdf)
