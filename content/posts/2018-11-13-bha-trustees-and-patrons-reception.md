Leading lights from the UK homeopathy and CAM community came together for a special BHA reception last Tuesday, 6th November. Key donors, homeopaths, MPs and supporters joined BHA trustees and our Royal Patron, HRH The Duke of Gloucester KG GCVO, for a night of music and conversation at London's Apothecaries Hall.

Guests were treated to a tour of the 17th century livery guild before speeches and refreshments in the Great Hall. His Royal Highness spoke of personal and family experiences of homeopathy. BHA Chair, Margaret Wyllie shared how, despite the challenges of recent years, the association continues to grow and welcomed new trustees and staff members. The night ended with Chief Executive, Cristal Sumner reiterating the BHAâ€™s commitment to promoting high quality homeopathic health care for all. She also hinted at some exciting changes to come!
