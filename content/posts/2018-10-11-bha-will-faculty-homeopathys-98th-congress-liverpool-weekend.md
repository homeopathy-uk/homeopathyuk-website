![Faculty of Homeopathy - 98th Congress - Liverpool 2018](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Faculty-of-Homeopathy-Liverpool-Congress-2018-Banner.jpg)

The Faculty of Homeopathy Congress is recognised as one of the most intellectually and socially stimulating events in the homeopathic calendar. Held this year in Liverpool at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on 11-14 October 2018.

The Congress is a biennial event, organised by the Faculty and open to members, associates, homeopaths, students of homeopathy and other healthcare professionals with an interest in homeopathy. Centred on the theme, Homeopathy: Connecting our Global Community, delegates will enjoy presentations, seminars and workshops delivered by leading homeopaths from the UK and around the globe.

The BHA will be an exhibitor at the event, sharing information about the projects we are funding, providing free leaflets and z-cards for practitioners, displaying selected artefacts from the Hahnemann House Trust collection and running a whiskey raffle to raise funds for student bursaries. The bursaries in honour of our long-standing chairman and Liverpudlian John Cook are for first-year student’s undertaking Faculty-accredited homeopathic education. Last Congress in 2016 we raised more than £1000 and are hoping to exceed that total by raffling off a 18 year old bottle, aptly named A Remedy for the Soul.

We look forward to seeing old and new friends there!
