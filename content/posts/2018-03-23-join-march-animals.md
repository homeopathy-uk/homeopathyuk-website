A demonstration march is taking place in April in support of veterinary homeopathy.

Organised by the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons (BAHVS), the March for Animals will be protesting against a position statement issued by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) which effectively deprives vets of the option of using homeopathy and other complementary treatments.

Chris Day, president of the BAHVS, says there is growing interest in homeopathy and other complementary therapies from animal owners.

“More and more pet owners and livestock farmers are seeking other options where conventional medicines have failed or produced adverse side-effects or when they just want to have their animals treated in a more holistic way.”

Protesters will gather in Parliament Square, London, on Monday 16 April at 12.30 pm before marching to the RCVS headquarters.

All who support the right of vets and animal owners to use and choose homeopathy in the treatment of their pets or livestock are welcome to join the march. For more details visit [www.bahvs.com/next-london-demonstration/](http://www.bahvs.com/next-london-demonstration/)

A petition calling on the RCVS to retract its position statement has already attracted 17,000 signatures. To sign the petition visit [www.cam4animals.co.uk/petition--get-involved.html](https://www.cam4animals.co.uk/petition--get-involved.html)
