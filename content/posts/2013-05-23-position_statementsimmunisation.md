**The BHA follows the advice of the Faculty of Homeopathy on immunisation:**

Where there is no medical contraindication, immunisation should be carried out in the normal way using the conventional tested and approved vaccines. Where there is a medical contraindication and/or a patient would otherwise remain unprotected against a specific infectious disease, it may be appropriate to consider the use of the relevant homeoprophylactic preparation applicable to that disease.

In the case of veterinary vaccination protocols, in view of the current debate about the necessity for annual boosters and about the evidence supporting recommended booster frequency and safety, the Faculty advises veterinary surgeons carefully to review the published evidence, in order to form an opinion and, if necessary to consult other Veterinary Members of the Faculty. This advice notwithstanding, the Faculty cannot support leaving animals with no form of prophylactic cover against the major, potentially lethal infectious diseases.
