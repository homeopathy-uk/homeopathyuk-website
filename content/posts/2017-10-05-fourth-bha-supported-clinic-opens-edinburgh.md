The British Homeopathic Association (BHA) has opened its fourth charitable clinic. The latest clinic is the third to open this year, and will serve the people of Edinburgh.

Operating from Mulberry House—Edinburgh’s largest complementary health centre—the BHA’s clinic is run by Karen Hooton, who in 2002 was one of the first NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) registered nurses to qualify as a Specialist Nurse Practitioner in Homeopathy.

She said: “I am very pleased and excited to be working with the BHA to provide a low-cost homeopathic clinic in Edinburgh. People who have missed NHS provision will be able to access homeopathy once again.

“I’ve been using homeopathy in clinical practice for more than 15 years and have found it to be effective for a wide range of acute and chronic conditions.”

The BHA opened its first charitable clinic in Norwich in 2011. Its success in terms of growing patient numbers and patient satisfaction is the driving force behind the BHA’s ambitious plan to open a number of clinics across the UK.

Cristal Sumner, the BHA’s chief executive, said: “These are exciting times for the BHA. Following the launch of charitable clinics in Bath, York and now Edinburgh, we are working towards bringing low-cost homeopathy to Liverpool and Cardiff in the early part of 2018.”

The BHA Edinburgh Charitable Clinic is located at:

Mulberry House
21 Manor Place
Edinburgh
EH3 7DX

For an appointment call 0131 225 2012.

Consultations at the clinic are free, although patients are encouraged to make a donation to help fund the long-term future of the clinic.
