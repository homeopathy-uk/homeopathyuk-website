![](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/noun_355373.svg) The BHA’s online campaign to raise money to fund a judicial review of NHS England’s consultation on its plans to stop prescriptions for homeopathic medicines, has reached its target of £16,000.

We are delighted at the generosity of our supporters who share our concerns over this attack on patient choice, said Cristal Sumner, BHA chief executive. The BHA’s legal team has identified serious flaws in NHS England’s consultation process, which if unchallenged could result in chronically ill patients being denied the treatment they have found beneficial to their health.

The money will help to pay for legal work already undertaken to lodge the application for judicial review. The BHA’s online fundraising will continue until 6 December and additional funds will go towards work being done to defend and clarify our case with the court. If you believe in patient choice in healthcare provision and want to see homeopathy as part of that choice, you can make a donation at [www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-homeopathy-on-the-nhs/](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-homeopathy-on-the-nhs/)

Thank you for your support.
