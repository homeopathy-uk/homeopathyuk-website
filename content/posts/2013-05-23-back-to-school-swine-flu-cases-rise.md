The number of swine flu cases reported in England has increased for the first time since the end of July.

Figures from the Royal College of GPs show that 5000 cases were reported last week, up from 3000, but this is still below the number of flu cases expected in a bad winter.

The rise is being attributed to children going back to school and the slightly cooler weather. Six schools have reported outbreaks, according to the BBC.
