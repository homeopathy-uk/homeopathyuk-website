This morning, the Government responded to the [BHA's petition ](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200154)to prevent NHS England abolishing GP prescriptions of herbal and homeopathic medicines. We now have over 14,600 signatures, so an official response was expected.

In essence, the government hasn't replied to the evidence brought forward in favour of homeopathic and other complementary treatments. Their response blames the rising costs of all prescriptions, citing the need to cut medicines considered of low clinical value. Despite all evidence provided proving the benefits of homeopathy, the statement concludes that:

<blockquote>"... We are not aware of any evidence that demonstrates the therapeutic effectiveness of homeopathic products."</blockquote>

Department of Health, _[Government responded](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200154#response-threshold)_

Please, we urge you to read about the clear and proven benefits of homeopathy, and our answers to the most common questions and challenges. We realise that homeopathy is controversial, and that very strong and seemingly incontrovertible statements are made about it. The Homeopathy Research Institute's [frequently asked questions](https://www.hri-research.org/resources/homeopathy-faqs/), is a compilation  of the most common accusations, along with answers according to available scientific evidence.

Then, please take a look at the Homeopathy Evidence Check [rebuttal](http://www.homeopathyevidencecheck.org/) of the questionable and biased manner a previous _evidence check_ on homeopathy was carried out, by the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee, in 2010.
