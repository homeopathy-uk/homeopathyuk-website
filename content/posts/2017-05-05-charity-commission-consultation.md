The Charity Commission is currently conducting a consultation as part of its review into whether organisations that promote CAM therapies are deserving of charity status.

To be registered as a charity the commission considers a number of factors, including whether the organisation’s purposes are beneficial to the public, and whether any potential harm may outweigh the benefits.

The Commission acknowledges the intensity of the debate surrounding evidence of CAM treatments, and therefore intends the consultation to be as open as possible.

**Submission deadline 19th May 2017**

Consultation details are available on the [Charity Commission site](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/598752/The_use_and_promotion_of_complementary_and_alternative_medicine.pdf).

Submissions can be made via email or post, details below:
