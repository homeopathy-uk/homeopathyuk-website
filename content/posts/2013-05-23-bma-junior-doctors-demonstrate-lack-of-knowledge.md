The Briitish Homeopathic Association support the Faculty of Homeopathy who have condemned the motion put forward by junior doctors calling for a halt to NHS funding of homeopathy.  The motion was put forward at a recent British Medical Association (BMA) conference.  The Faculty also expressed concern about the unfounded criticisms levelled at doctors who practice homeopathy by junior doctors at the conference.

‘As a doctor in practice for over 30 years, not only do I depend on homeopathy as an important tool in daily practice, but more than that, I feel it enables me to be the kind of doctor I always aspired to be.', stated Dr Bob Leckridge, Locum Consultant in Homeopathy at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, a BMA member and past president of the Faculty of Homeopathy.

‘There is a growing body of evidence for homeopathy and it is an important part of the National Health Service helping tens of thousands of patients annually, a majority of whom have not been helped sufficiently with conventional treatments. Outcome studies repeatedly demonstrate that patients feel healthier after homeopathic treatment.  If a patient is healthier they may reduce their need to use expensive NHS services and require less costly conventional drugs. Homeopathy offers an affordable solution for both patients and the NHS and to suggest cutting such a service would seem economically and socially unsound.’

Cristal Sumner, Chief Executive of the British Homeopathic Association said, ‘To state that people should pay for homeopathic care, means only those who have money really have a choice.  Patients that have chronic health issues more often than not do not have funds to pay for private care as they are too ill to work.  As UK taxpayer each of us pays for our health care and we should have the choice to access healthcare that works for us.  It is unbelievable that a group of inexperienced doctors think they have the right to make decisions for us all.’
