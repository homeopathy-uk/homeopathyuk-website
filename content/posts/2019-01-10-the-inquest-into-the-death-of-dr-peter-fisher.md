The
family of Dr Peter Fisher has called upon the Mayor of London to ‘urgently
address’ cycling safety in the city. Dr Fisher [was
killed in a collision with a lorry](http://localhost/bha-blog/esteemed-homeopathic-physician-dr-peter-fisher-dies-tragic-accident/) while cycling to work in August 2017. In a statement read out
during the inquest into his death yesterday (9th January), his
sister Suzie Herne said:

<blockquote>‘In order to save further precious lives, we urge the mayor of London to urgently address the issue of cycle safety in London by looking at people-prioritised streets and improved lorry design. Dr Peter Fisher was a remarkably gifted and special man whose death is a tragic and irreplaceable loss, not only for his family and friends who loved him dearly, but also to the cause of medicine and homeopathy in this country and worldwide’.

Dr Fisher was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash and the
lorry was travelling at less than 8mph, the inquest, at St Pancras Coroners
Court, heard. A verdict of accidental death was recorded.

Dr Fisher was a trustee of the British
Homeopathic Association, President of the Faculty of Homeopathy and the Queen’s
Homeopathic Physician.
