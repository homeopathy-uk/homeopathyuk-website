_Hope you like our new blog on our new website. It’s a new beginning for the website which is now easier to use so you can get the information you need more quickly. I quite like the slider and videos on the homepage and the map in the find a practitioner section is pretty cool. It has taken a lot of work and it was with a bit of trepidation going live but we are excited to hear what you think about the site._

Parenting can be scary too. This time last year I was a new mother with a two-month-old baby to look after and it was all still rather new and nerve-wracking. Now my daughter is fourteen months old and on the brink of walking. With babies and children there is always something new happening. First they roll over, then they sit up, suddenly they can crawl (and at speed) and then they can stand up. Parenting is a constant roll of new beginnings, once you get used to things being one way they suddenly change.

Whoever you are, parenting can be a challenge as I’m sure William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are finding out now with little George. The worst bit for me was lack of sleep, though thankfully I am one of those people who can sleep in the day while the baby is asleep.  I imagine Kate has a nanny who can get up in the night, though I did hear they want to be more “hands-on” and not have as much help as you’d usually expect with members of the Royal Family.

The Royal Family are known to use homeopathy as part of their healthcare and it can help with those minor ailments that all babies get  from time to time, such as teething, nappy rash and coughs and colds. Many parents are wary of giving their children conventional medicines too often; I only give my daughter Calpol if she definitely needs it, so homeopathy is a safe and gentle alternative.

<blockquote>But homeopathy is not just for babies and children; it is suitable for all ages. So if you’ve not used homeopathy before, why not give it a go.</blockquote>

It will be a new beginning to how you approach your personal healthcare that will benefit you for the rest of your life.
