_This autumn, the first of what we hope will be a series of regional events to promote homeopathy and other CAM therapies to the public and the healthcare profession took place in Norwich._

Norwich was chosen to stage the first events because that is where the BHA funded homeopathic clinic is located. The events were very different and held over two days at the city’s Assembly House.

The first event was a reception for the patients and supporters of the Norwich homeopathic clinic and was hosted by Dr Katalin Borbely who runs the clinic. Guests were welcomed by the BHA’s chairman, John Cook. They enjoyed afternoon tea and the opportunity to discuss the work of the clinic, NHS policy on homeopathy and integrative care, and the challenges currently faced by the homeopathic community.

<blockquote>All who attended were effusive in their praise of Dr Borbely’s work at the clinic and keen to pledge their continued support.</blockquote>

All who attended were effusive in their praise of Dr Borbely’s work at the clinic and keen to pledge their continued support. Furthermore, many guests commented on how delighted they were to have been given the opportunity to meet other supporters of the clinic.

The following day the people of Norwich and local healthcare professionals came along to learn more about homeopathy and other complementary therapies. They heard a number of speakers including Dr Sara Eames talking about homeopathy; Sue Saunders, vice-principal of the Homeopathic College of East Anglia, who spoke on natural fertility; and Dr Simon Heyhoe from the University Hospital Colchester, who highlighted the clinical and economic benefits of acupuncture in NHS practice. Other speakers included the clinical hypnotherapist Irina Valentino, osteopath William Allchin and the medical herbalist Andrew Chevallier.

Following the success of our two days in Norwich, the BHA is planning similar events in other parts of the country. If you would like a BHA event to take place in the town or city where you live, please email [info@britishhomeopathic.org](mailto:info@britishhomeopathic.org) with your ideas.
