A study published this week in _Fertility and Sterility _journal has found that women suffering from endometriosis are twice as likely to have a premature birth. According to the Bupa Foundation, which funded the research, it will now be easier to identify women who are at a higher risk of premature birth (44% of women show no signs of endometriosis) through the use of ultrasound in the early stages of pregnancy.

Endometriosis is where cells that are usually only found in the womb lining (endometrium) start to grow on organs outside the womb, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. The most common symptom is pelvic pain that feels like bad period pain. Other symptoms include back pain during periods, painful bowel movements, difficulty becoming pregnant and fatigue.

Homeopathy can have great results in women suffering from endometriosis:
